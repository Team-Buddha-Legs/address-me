## Chapter I

Deepen Reforms and Committed to
People’s Livelihood
1.
This year marks the conclusion of the National 14th Five-Year Plan period and
the preparatory year for the 15th Five-Year Plan.  This Policy Address serves as a roadmap
for Hong Kong to strive for a vibrant economy, pursue development, and improve
people’s livelihood – accelerating our advancement from stability to prosperity.  It also
outlines a strategic plan for Hong Kong to proactively align with national development
strategies and achieve breakthroughs in forging a new landscape.
2.
My ultimate objective in governance is to improve people’s livelihood with
better housing for members of the public, higher income for workers, enhanced care
for the elderly, and greater prospects for young people.  The well-being of our people is
intimately linked to the health of our economy, making economic growth the key driver
of livelihood improvement.  Growth creates job opportunities and wealth, which will in
turn generate additional resources for public services, enabling the Government to deliver
more and better services.  Improvement in people’s livelihood will then spark new social
demands that stimulate market development, further promoting economic growth.  The
economy and people’s livelihood are mutually reinforcing: each strengthens the other.
3.
Since taking office, I have been actively promoting reforms, both within the
Government and in the wider community, thereby facilitating economic growth and
improving people’s livelihood.  I have transformed and instilled in the Government
a culture that is “result-oriented”.  We have been pressing ahead with public housing
production and introduced Light Public Housing (LPH).  Three years ago, applicants
for public rental housing (PRH) waited an average of 6.1 years for a flat; the Composite
Waiting Time is now 5.1 years, a reduction of one full year.  Over the same period, the
median household income rose by $3,000, an increase of 11%.  Since I assumed office, the
economy has rebounded – turning from negative to positive and gaining momentum.  This
year’s growth is projected at 2% – 3%.  In the past three years, Hong Kong has moved up
one place to become the third-ranked global financial centre and has climbed four spots
to rank third globally in overall competitiveness.  In the last two years, we have risen
12 places to the fourth globally in talent competitiveness.  Furthermore, Hong Kong is
ranked seventh among the world’s top 10 safest cities.
4.
The Policy Address this year is anchored in two pillars: the economy and
people’s livelihood.
5.
The Northern Metropolis is the new engine for Hong Kong’s economic
development and holds immense potential.  I will accelerate its development and set
up the Committee on Development of the Northern Metropolis under my guidance
to formulate operational models for the various development areas therein.  I will also
expedite the development of the University Town, streamline administrative procedures
2
by removing barriers and easing restrictions, adopt safe, efficient and cost-effective
construction practices, and introduce dedicated legislation to fast-track the Northern
Metropolis development.  The Government will attract and cultivate industries to create
jobs and enhance productivity.  Preferential policy packages will also be formulated to
improve efficiency and flexibility in negotiations with enterprises that are establishing and
scaling up operations, thereby creating more high-quality, high income jobs and further
boosting productivity.
6.
Under “One Country, Two Systems”, Hong Kong enjoys the unique advantages
of attracting overseas enterprises and assisting Mainland enterprises to go global.  In
the past, we focused primarily on bringing in enterprises, achieving remarkable growth
and success.  The new opportunities ahead for Hong Kong, however, will come from
helping Mainland enterprises expand abroad.  This rapid shift in opportunities reflects
the reshaping of the global trade order, prompting Mainland enterprises to shift from
concentrating on a single market and towards proactively tapping into emerging markets.
The Government will leverage Hong Kong’s strength as a platform for going global to
reinforce the role of Hong Kong as an international centre, capitalising on our advantages
in areas such as finance, trading, professional services, supply chain management and
professional networks, creating more jobs and higher income, further promoting the
headquarters economy to unlock more business opportunities.  We will also develop
education, technology and talent in an integrated manner, and press ahead with the
integrated development of culture, sports and tourism, enabling the people of Hong Kong
to live in a community with thriving economy and vibrant culture.
7.
To strengthen governance, I will establish an accountability system for Heads
of Department (HoDs) by systematising and institutionalising their responsibility for
their departments, and enhance the appraisal system for civil servants so that a culture
of continuous improvement can take root.  I will also set up the AI Efficacy Enhancement
Team to drive technological reform, co-ordinating and steering government departments
in the effective use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and in the re-engineering of
outdated workflows.  Meanwhile, I will promote the development of AI+ with strong
emphasis on safety risk prevention, and implement AI government services and facilitate
the wide-scale application and development of AI across different sectors in the society to
boost overall efficiency.  I will also put into practice the philosophy of better integration of
“an efficient market” with “a capable government”, and introduce market-based business
model to enhance the services of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD).
8.
This Policy Address concludes with the most extensive chapter concerning
people’s livelihood.  It encompasses nine critical areas which are essential to the well-being
of the community, covering land and housing, transport, healthcare, social welfare, labour
protection and a caring and inclusive society, under which include continuously increasing
public housing supply to enrich the housing ladder; creating land for large development
projects, promoting long-term economic development and addressing housing needs
while increasing government land reserve; continuing healthcare reform; implementing
11 measures to support local economy, continuing the work on targeted poverty alleviation,
3
promoting the principle of “ageing in place as the core, with institutional care as back-up”,
supporting and protecting workers, and establishing the Working Group on Ageing
Society Strategies to meet the challenges brought by ageing.  These demonstrates my
commitment to placing people’s livelihood at the heart of governance.  Indeed, economic
development ultimately serves the well-being of our people, enabling them to enjoy better
quality of life.
9.
I would like to thank the public for their valuable opinions during the
consultation exercise, and for their broad support of my policy directions and strategies.
This Policy Address will elaborate on our policy objectives, key measures and key
performance indicators (KPIs).  A Supplement offering more details on the policy measures
and related matters has also been compiled.

## Chapter II

Steadfastly and Successfully Implement
“One Country, Two Systems” and
Strengthen Our Governance Systems
(A) Resolutely Implement
the “One Country, Two Systems” Principle
“One Country, Two Systems” Remains Unchanged
10.
As President Xi Jinping pointed out, “One Country, Two Systems” possesses
its distinctive institutional strengths and strong vitality, is a good system that sustains
the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao.  It is a good system
that facilitates endeavours to build China into a great country and achieve national
rejuvenation, and it is a good system for ensuring peaceful coexistence and mutual benefit
between different social systems.  So we must stay committed to this cause.
11.
We will continue to fully, faithfully and resolutely implement “One Country,
Two Systems”, “Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong” and a high degree
of autonomy.  “One Country, Two Systems” is the best institutional arrangement for
maintaining Hong Kong’s long-term prosperity and stability.  The more firmly the
“One Country” principle is upheld, the greater the strength the “Two Systems” will be
unleashed.
12.
Being a global metropolis, Hong Kong has remained an open, inclusive, safe
and stable city underpinned by the rule of law since our return to the Motherland 28 years
ago.  With an ever-expanding influence internationally, Hong Kong is rated the world’s
freest economy, as well as an advanced and business-friendly city.  These fully demonstrate
the notable institutional strengths and great vitality of “One Country, Two Systems”.
13.
Hong Kong has solid backing from the Motherland, enjoying far-reaching
opportunities brought by national development, from the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao
Greater Bay Area (GBA) to the Belt and Road (B&R) Initiative.  Meanwhile, as an
international city with its distinctive role of connecting to the rest of the world, Hong Kong
also has infinite room for development.
14.
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government will,
as always, maintain the constitutional order of the HKSAR as stipulated under the
Constitution and the Basic Law, ensuring the steadfast and successful implementation of
“One Country, Two Systems”.
5
Safeguard National Security
15.
The fundamental premise of “One Country, Two Systems” is to safeguard
sovereignty, security and development interests of our nation.
16.
Since the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law five years
ago, we have overcome turmoil and unrest, and maintained safety and stability in our
society.  Hong Kong has transitioned from chaos to order and is now advancing from
stability to prosperity.  The HKSAR Government will continue to steadfastly safeguard
national sovereignty, security and development interests, while thoroughly adopting the
Holistic Approach to National Security.  We will remain vigilant at all times, prevent and
mitigate risks, and ensure the long-term stability and safety of Hong Kong.
17.
We will continue to enhance the legal system and enforcement mechanism for
safeguarding national security, doing our utmost to ensure that laws are observed and
strictly enforced to bring offenders to account, so as to prevent, suppress and impose
punishment for acts and activities endangering national security.
18.
The Government will spare no effort in promoting national security education.
Since its opening a year ago, the National Security Exhibition Gallery has already attracted
over one million visitors.  More than 3 300 national security education district tutors have
been trained to promote national security messages in the community.
Implement “Patriots Administering Hong Kong”
19.
With the improved electoral system and district governance system of the
HKSAR, the principle of “patriots administering Hong Kong” has been fully implemented.
The HKSAR Government has held six important elections, including the recent Election
Committee Subsector By-elections.
20.
The HKSAR will devote all efforts in preparing for the general election for the
eighth-term Legislative Council (LegCo) to be held on 7 December this year, ensuring that
the election is conducted in a fair, just, honest, safe and orderly manner.
Improve Governance at District Level
21.
As part of the reforms to improve district governance, the Government
set up the Steering Committee on District Governance and the Task Force on District
Governance in July 2023.  They are chaired by the Chief Secretary for Administration and
the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration respectively, with the aim of strengthening
co-ordination to address issues such as environmental hygiene, community beautification,
facility development and community services more effectively.
6
22.
The Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (HYAB) and the Home Affairs Department
(HAD) will continue to lead District Councils (DCs), the “three district committees”1 and
Care Teams to proactively harness local strengths to foster compassion and vibrancy
within the community.
(B) Patriotic Education
Commemorate the 80th Anniversary of Victory in the Chinese People’s
War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and in the World
Anti-Fascist War
23.
This year marks the 80th anniversary of victory in the Chinese People’s
War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and in the World Anti-Fascist War.
The HKSAR Government has organised a series of large-scale commemorative activities,
including exhibitions, film screenings and library events, for the public to gain a deeper
understanding of the spirit of unity and resilience displayed by Chinese people in the
fight for peace.  We will collaborate with Shenzhen to promote a new red educational
route, under the theme of “Chinese Cultural Celebrity Rescue” history, so as to enhance
understanding among people of Hong Kong and tourists of the history of the War of
Resistance in Hong Kong.
24.
We will comprehensively review and conduct restoration and protection work
on historic sites relating to the participation of the Communist Party of China in the War
of Resistance in various districts, with a view to integrating them into tourism routes and
educational activities.
Promote Chinese Culture
25.
The Government will give full play to the role of the Chinese Culture
Promotion Office.  This includes curating the Chinese Culture Festival and exhibitions
of the General History of China series as signature projects, and spearheading the
establishment of a museum to showcase the development and achievements of our
country, as well as the Chinese Culture Experience Centre.  The Office will also continue to
launch a broad spectrum of community-oriented initiatives to promote Chinese culture.
Promote Activities and Facilities on Patriotic Education
26.
The Government will promote patriotic education facilities in the Mainland,
making them the patriotic education bases of the HKSAR to encourage more students and
young people to visit.
27.
We will establish close connection with patriotic groups to unite efforts in
organising more patriotic education activities.
1
Area Committees, District Fight Crime Committees and District Fire Safety Committees.
7
Strengthen Students’ Affection for and Sense of Belonging to the Country
28.
The Education Bureau (EDB) will integrate patriotic education into daily
learning and teaching.  We will popularise the “Love Our Home, Treasure Our Country”
series of activities, continuously strengthen the Constitution and Basic Law Student
Ambassadors Training Scheme, design itineraries for students to experience the founding
history of our country, and conduct focus inspections on national education.  We will also
continue to provide professional development and activities for teachers and students that
tie in with the updated national security education, promulgate the final version of the
Values Education Curriculum Framework, and optimise the curriculum frameworks for the
senior secondary Chinese History and History subjects.
(C) Further Enhance Governance
Establish the Heads of Department Accountability System
29.
Since assuming office, I have been constantly taking forward reforms to build a
“result-oriented” government.  In the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025, Hong Kong
ranked second globally in “Government efficiency”, reflecting well on Hong Kong’s civil
servants being an outstanding team, and the reforms introduced by the current-term
Government, alongside the concerted efforts of the civil service.
30.
Nevertheless, given the large number of executive departments and officers in
the Government, problems inevitably occur in individual departments.  The causes behind
them must be identified in good time and rectified to prevent them from undermining the
overall trust that society places in the Government, and to avoid causing injustice to the
overwhelming majority of our civil servants, who are dedicated to their duties.
31.
I believe that effective management is of utmost importance.  Senior civil
servants are all responsible for management.  I have therefore been considering ways to
strengthen their sense of responsibility to enhance the overall management standard of
the departments.  After considerations, I believe that the most direct and effective way is
to strengthen the accountability of the HoDs by clearly emphasising that HoDs are tasked
to build a strong management team, and lead their senior civil servants to jointly manage
staff and operation systems.  While HoDs have always been responsible for the work of
their departments, the Government has not yet institutionalised overall accountability.
Establishing a Heads of Department Accountability System (the HoD Accountability
System), therefore, is of critical significance.  The details are as follows.
8
Aims
32.
Establishing the HoD Accountability System has the following primary aims:
(i)
To render the political accountability required of Secretaries of Department
and Directors of Bureau in policy formulation, and the administrative
accountability required of civil servants in implementing policy initiatives
better articulated with each other, with clarification of their respective roles.
(ii)
To drive HoDs to establish an effective management team and operating
systems, eliminating bottlenecks and plugging shortfalls, improving
workflow on an ongoing basis, and continuously enhancing departmental
efficiency.
(iii)
To identify the deficiencies whenever a problem occurs in a department,
putting in place improvements, attributing responsibility to the appropriate
parties, and taking administrative or disciplinary actions against those
responsible in accordance with the civil service management regime.  The
consequences include warnings, reprimands, not being granted a salary
increment, relegation in rank, reduction in salary, compulsory retirement
and even dismissal.
The Investigation Mechanism
33.
Investigations will be divided into two tiers, in accordance with the severity of
the problems identified:
(i)
Tier I: if the problems are of a general nature, the investigation should be
taken up by the HoD concerned.  They will be responsible for identifying
the deficiencies of the department and putting in place improvements,
taking forward administrative or disciplinary actions against the officers
who have underperformed or engaged in misconduct in accordance with
the civil service management regime.
(ii)
Tier II: if a serious problem occurs in a department or the problem is
widespread or a repetitive, systemic one, or there are indications that the
HoD concerned is implicated in the problem, the investigation will be
carried out by an investigation panel set up specifically under the HoD
Accountability System.  The panel will identify the deficiencies of the
department and attribute responsibility to the appropriate parties.  It should
be independent from the Government, such that the investigation will be
impartial and independent.  It should be able to examine civil servants of all
ranks to ensure that the investigation is thorough.  It should be familiar with
the general operation of the Government, to ensure that the investigation
is completed efficiently.  It should be a standing team to be called upon,
ensuring its certainty and readiness.
9
Independent Panel of Investigation
34.
To achieve the aforementioned aims, I will expand the existing functions of
the Public Service Commission2 to enable it to conduct investigations.  Independent of
the Government and in operation for many years, the commission is conversant with the
management system of the civil service.  Its current statutory functions include advising
the Chief Executive on matters affecting the public service (including disciplinary cases
of civil servants).  The existing functions of the commission do not cover investigation.
Extending its functions to include investigation, and inviting experts or government
officials not related to the department being investigated to participate, can ensure both
the independence and impartiality of the investigations concerned as well as the efficiency
of the investigation, thereby achieving the four requirements set out in paragraph 33(ii).
35.
The Government will make subsidiary legislation under the Public Service
Commission Ordinance to implement the above proposal.
Activation Mechanism
36.
When a situation as described in paragraph 33(ii) occurs in a department, the
relevant Director of Bureau must report it to the Secretary of Department concerned.
Upon obtaining the latter’s agreement, the Director of Bureau should activate the
Tier II independent investigation mechanism.  The Secretary of Department concerned
can also, on their own initiative, direct the relevant Director of Bureau to activate the
investigation mechanism.
Strengthen the Performance Appraisal System for Civil Servants
37.
The overall performance of civil servants is fundamental to the effectiveness
of departments.  A fair and honest assessment of staff performance can encourage
good-performers to strive for excellence, and suitably handle staff who have
under-performed or misconducted themselves.  In this connection, establishing an effective
performance appraisal system will help HoDs enhance the overall effectiveness of the
departments, raise the morale of good performers, assist those with room for improvement
to improve their capability, and handle the small number of staff involved in misconduct
in a fair manner.
38.
The Civil Service Bureau is tasked to conduct a study developing a more
rigorous performance appraisal system that reflects and differentiates the performance
levels of staff more effectively.
2
The Public Service Commission, consisting of a Chairman and two to eight members, is a statutory body
established under the Public Service Commission Ordinance.  Its functions include advising the Chief Executive
regarding the public service and matters affecting the conduct and discipline of public officers; the Ordinance
also empowers the Chief Executive in Council to make regulations.
10
39.
Apart from assessing the performance of senior civil servants (including HoDs)
in accordance with the existing mechanism, Secretaries of Department and Directors of
Bureau will need to supervise the senior civil servants under their charge to properly
perform personnel management work for staff at all ranks, including performance
appraisal, posting, promotion and discipline.
Set up an AI Efficacy Enhancement Team
40.
The application of AI in the work of the Government can effectively enhance
efficiency.  The Census and Statistics Department, for example, has applied AI technology
to examine trade data and retrieve financial information from the financial statements
and announcements of thousands of listed companies for statistical compilation.  This has
resulted in an exponential surge in efficiency.  The 1823 services also use AI technology to
recognise automatically voice enquiries from members of the public, and help draft written
responses, reducing about 30% of the processing time.
41.
To further enhance the efficacy of the Government, I will set up an AI Efficacy
Enhancement Team to co-ordinate and steer government departments to:
(i)
Apply AI technology effectively to their work.
(ii)
Explore process re-engineering to keep pace with the times.
(iii)
Promote technological reform in departments to improve efficacy.
42.
The team will be led by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, with
the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry and the Commissioner for Digital
Policy serving as the Deputy Leader and Secretary General respectively.  The team will
also invite a representative from the private sector to serve as another Deputy Leader, to
bring in new perspectives and front-line market experience.  The team will examine with
government departments their need for reform, with priority given to departments with
greater interface with the public.  Departments may also initiate request to the team for
prioritised assistance in enhancing their efficiency.

## Chapter III

Accelerate the Development of the
Northern Metropolis
43.
The Northern Metropolis, our city’s strategic development area bordering
Shenzhen, covers a land area and planned population intake accounting for about
one-third of Hong Kong’s total.  It therefore represents a substantial source of economic
value and development potential, creating many jobs and boosting productivity.  While
the Government has been accelerating the development of the Northern Metropolis for the
past three years, I remain deeply concerned about its progress, given the sheer size of the
area and the magnitude of the investment required.
44.
To further develop our economy and improve people’s livelihood, we must
speed up the Northern Metropolis development.  Accordingly, I have decided to raise the
level of decision-making by establishing the Committee on Development of the Northern
Metropolis3 under my leadership.  The committee will be tasked with streamlining
administrative workflows and removing unnecessary barriers and restrictions.  Embracing
a new mind-set, we will adopt safe, cost-efficient, and time-saving construction methods,
materials, and equipment from different jurisdictions.  We will also introduce dedicated
legislation to accelerate the development of the Northern Metropolis.
(A) Establish the Committee on Development of the
Northern Metropolis
45.
With the overall planning of the Northern Metropolis, it is now the optimal
juncture to expedite the development of the area, bringing in industries and major projects.
I will establish and chair the Committee on Development of the Northern Metropolis,
under which the following three working groups will be set up:
(i)
Working Group on Devising Development and Operation Models: led by
the Financial Secretary, the working group will formulate development
and operation models for industry parks in the Northern Metropolis,
taking into account their nature and scale.  This will include setting up
one or more dedicated companies, or statutory or non-statutory bodies, for
various industrial parks, devising public-private partnership approaches
such as the Build-Operate-Transfer model.  It will also explore shifting from
“highest bidder wins” to industry-linked “two-envelope approach” for
tendering.  We will devise a range of financing schemes, including equity,
bonds, government injections, and “provision of land as a form of capital
participation”.  The Development Bureau (DEVB) is conducting policy study
3
The existing Steering Committee on the Northern Metropolis will be discontinued.
12
to set up an industry park company for about 23 hectares of industry land
at Hung Shui Kiu.  The recommendations will be announced this year after
reporting to the working group.
(ii)
Working Group on Planning and Construction of the University Town: led
by the Chief Secretary for Administration, the working group will study
the development mode for the Northern Metropolis University Town.  It
will set up a research task force to conduct field trips on the successful
models of university towns elsewhere, seeking views from presidents and
representatives of local, Mainland, and other internationally renowned
universities.  It will also explore the possible way forward to deeply integrate
industry development with the academic sectors where Hong Kong has an
edge, alongside the strategies for attracting leading universities and research
institutes in the Mainland and overseas to establish a base in Hong Kong.
Three batches of sites for the Northern Metropolis University Town will be
available for use in 2026 (Hung Shui Kiu), 2028 (Ngau Tam Mei) and 2030
(New Territories North New Town) respectively at the earliest.  The working
group will make recommendations on the positioning and vision regarding
the development of these sites to devise a clear, industry-led approach.  The
land in the Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen New Development Area (NDA), for
example, will integrate with nearby, high-end professional services as well
as vocational and professional education and training facilities for joint
development.  The land in Ngau Tam Mei can dovetail with the overall
innovation and technology (I&T) development of the San Tin Technopole
and the Loop, among others, life and health technology industries, and to be
used for joint development with the third medical school and an integrated
medical teaching and research hospital.
(iii)
Working Group on Planning and Development: led by the Deputy
Financial Secretary, the working group will be responsible for managing
the end-to-end process from planning to implementation, co-ordinating and
consolidating such aspects as planning, engineering, land, transportation
and environmental protection, to promote industry anchoring, create job
opportunities and enhance productivity.  A dedicated project supervision
office will be established under the working group to strengthen the
co-ordination and supervision of the approval process, imposing time limits
and phased reporting, to accelerate progress.
13
(B) Remove Barriers and Ease Restrictions to
Streamline Administrative Procedures
46.
The Government will streamline administrative procedures, removing barriers
and restrictions.  Relevant measures include:
(i)
Introduce the Fast Track Processing System, adopting superior construction
methods from different places, and integrate successful construction
technologies, materials and equipment from the Mainland and overseas, in a
bid to reduce construction costs and time.
(ii)
Implement a “phased development” approach on a trial basis with reference
to the Mainland’s “1.5-level development” concept.  Specifically, pilot
low-density facilities, such as retail, entertainment and convention and
exhibition facilities will be developed initially to attract businesses, bringing
income and footfall to the area to create momentum before long-term
development is rolled out.  We will invite market feedback on such approach
of phased development for the commercial sites in Hung Shui Kiu.
(iii)
Adopt diverse models such as in-situ land exchange and large-scale land
disposal to promote market participation and expedite development.
(iv)
Employ flexible land-grant arrangements, encouraging enterprises to set up
businesses and invest in the area.  Sites granted as tenancy instead of land
lease may have a term exceeding seven years to provide greater flexibility.
Depending on industry policies, open tendering, restricted tendering or
direct land grants may be adopted.
(v)
Allow land owners in the Northern Metropolis to voluntarily surrender land
planned to be resumed by the Government to offset the amount payable
for in-situ land exchange or large-scale land disposal in NDAs.  This will
promote market participation in the development.
(vi)
Adopt a “pay for what you build” approach to reduce the cost of land
premiums in the Northern Metropolis.  In lease modifications, subject to the
condition of the land parcels involved, owners will be allowed to pay the
required premium according to the actual built floor area and use, rather
than the maximum floor area based on the maximum plot ratio under the
current planning regime.  We will also consider allowing developers to pay
land premiums in phases, according to the development scale.
14
(vii)
Commence a land use review for Au Tau, to capitalise on the development
potential brought by the Northern Link.  We will consider a larger
proportion of private housing in the area around Sha Po at Au Tau Station
for development into an NDA.  We will engage the Mass Transit Railway
Corporation Limited (MTRCL) to conduct the review, announcing its results
next year.
47.
Where appropriate, we may also apply the above administrative measures to
areas outside the Northern Metropolis.
(C) Dedicated Legislation to Accelerate the
Development of Northern Metropolis
48.
I will introduce dedicated legislation to accelerate the development of Northern
Metropolis, empowering the Government to devise simplified statutory procedures for
issues including setting up statutory industry park companies and providing them with
dedicated channels for funding; managing the cross-boundary flow of people, goods,
capital, data and biological samples in designated areas, to attract research institutes and
high-end manufacturers to establish a presence in Hong Kong; speeding up the approval
of building plans; relaxing permitted uses in outline zoning plans (OZPs) and fine-tuning
development parameters; and expediting compensation payment for land resumption.
(D) Expedite the Development of the Loop
49.
The Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation
Co-operation Zone (the Co-operation Zone) is located on both sides of the Shenzhen River,
comprising Shenzhen Park and Hong Kong Park.  Leveraging the advantages of “one
zone, two parks”, the Co-operation Zone will promote collaboration between the two
parks in the development of I&T.
50.
The construction of the first three buildings in Phase 1 of the Hong Kong
Park of the Co-operation Zone (Hong Kong Park) has been completed.  Tenants from
life and health technology, microelectronics, new energy, AI and other pillar industries
are gradually moving in.  The construction of the other five buildings will be completed
progressively from 2027.
51.
The Government will roll out parcels of the remaining land in Phase 1 this
year.  We will complete Phase 2 planning for the development scale and distribution of
industries to finalise Hong Kong Park’s overall layout and consider offering work spaces
flexibly to companies under the “moving in while construction is underway” approach.
That will enable them to move in earlier without having to wait for the completion of the
entire park’s construction.
15
(E) Development Outline for the San Tin Technopole
52.
The San Tin Technopole, spanning some 210 hectares4 of land for I&T, will serve
as a strategic base for the I&T industry.  The Government will publish the Conceptual
Outline of the Development Plan for the Innovation and Technology Industry in the San
Tin Technopole this year.  It will cover top-level planning, industry positioning and layout,
the co-ordinated development of land parcels, and the strategies for channelling market
resources to invest in the development.
(F) Expedite Transport Infrastructural Development
53.
To dovetail with the development of the Northern Metropolis, construction
works of Kwu Tung Station and Hung Shui Kiu Station are proceeding in full swing
for completion in 2027 and 2030 respectively.  Adopting an innovative mind-set,
the Government has signed the Part 1 Project Agreement with the MTRCL.  It will
concurrently develop the Northern Link Spur Line in combination with the Main Line,
achieving simultaneous commissioning by 2034 or earlier.
54.
Cross-boundary railway projects will lead to the comprehensive integration
of metro networks in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, significantly enhancing the GBA’s
infrastructure connectivity and boosting industry’s confidence in setting up operations.
We are pressing ahead with the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Rail Link (Hung
Shui Kiu-Qianhai) project and have invited expressions of interest from contractors and
operators on the Hong Kong section of the project.
4
Not including the 87-hectare Hong Kong Park.
16

## Chapter IV

Industry Development and Reform
55.
Industries are the cornerstone of economic development.  The Government
will leverage market forces through enhanced measures, such as flexible land grant
arrangements, tax concessions, capital subsidies and talent grooming, so as to drive
industry development.
56.
The service industry accounts for a significant share of our economy.
In response to an increasingly dynamic market environment and rapid technological
change, the Government will pursue structural upgrades of our industries.  We will
consolidate our traditional strengths in sectors such as financial and legal services, while
actively nurturing emerging ones, including advanced manufacturing, life and health
technology, new energy, AI and data science, to create more high-quality job opportunities,
increasing people’s income and enhancing overall economic efficiency.
(A) Formulate Preferential Policy Packages to
Attract More Enterprises
57.
The Financial Secretary will lead the relevant policy bureaux, departments,
and public organisations in formulating packages of preferential policies including land
grants, land premiums, financial subsidies, and tax incentives, to attract high value-added
industries and high-potential enterprises to set up in Hong Kong, thereby promoting
high-quality development.
58.
The Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises and Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK)
can use the policy packages flexibly during negotiations with enterprises on settlement
details, then report to the Financial Secretary for approval.  The Government will also
explore the establishment of a more flexible mechanism, including allowing the Chief
Executive and the Financial Secretary to introduce tax incentives that comply with
international standards.
(B) Attract and Develop Industries
59.
The Government attaches great importance to fostering high value-added
advanced manufacturing using I&T, and promoting new industrialisation.  With the
sustained growth in the output of new industries, the Government will step up its
efforts to nurture emerging industries locally and attract those from outside Hong Kong,
promoting the diversified development of our economy.
17
Attract an Aircraft Recycling Enterprise and Train Relevant Talents
60.
The Government has reached an agreement of intent with a leading European
aeronautic services company to operate in Hong Kong.  The company will provide aircraft
dismantling, as well as recycling and trading services of high-value parts.  This will drive
the development of industries such as trading, insurance, financing and leasing, creating
new job opportunities through the sector’s value chain.  The company will also collaborate
with the Hong Kong International Aviation Academy to provide talent training in relevant
professions, which will in turn consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international aviation
hub.
Promote the Development of the Life and Health Technology Industry
61.
Hong Kong’s life and health technology research is flourishing, underpinned
by a mature system connecting the Government and the industry, as well as the
academic, research and investment sectors.  It aligns with the rise of innovative drugs
through home-grown research and development (R&D) in our country and expands
into international markets through patent licensing, delivering substantial economic and
strategic opportunities for Hong Kong.
Attract More Top-notch International and Mainland Pharmaceutical
Companies to Set up Operations in Hong Kong
62.
We will attract more pharmaceutical companies to set up operations in
Hong Kong to conduct clinical trials and medical treatments for rare disease drugs,
high-end cancer drugs and advanced therapy products.  We will proactively enhance the
efficiency of patient recruitment and trial initiation.  We will also make use of the GBA
Clinical Trial Collaboration Platform in the Hetao area, enabling pharmaceutical companies
to conduct trials simultaneously in Hong Kong and Shenzhen.  Concurrently, we will
prepare to set up the International Clinical Trial Academy for nurturing clinical trial
professionals in the GBA and host international summits and forums.
63.
The Government will set up the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products
Regulation and submit a legislative proposal on regulating medical devices in 2026, with
a view to establishing the centre as an internationally recognised regulatory authority
for medical products as soon as possible.  We will expedite the “1+” mechanism for new
drugs, piloting priority evaluation and approval of innovative drugs recommended by
the Hospital Authority (HA) for treatment of severe or rare diseases.  This will help
pharmaceutical companies bring innovative drugs to the market sooner.  In addition, we
will promote the standardisation of clinical data within the GBA and establish a real-world
data platform to help pharmaceutical companies bring innovative drugs to the Mainland
and international markets more quickly.
18
64.
The HA will establish the Office for Introducing Innovative Drugs and Medical
Devices.  It will identify the needs and benefits of innovative drug treatments for local
patients through big data analytics, bringing in innovative drugs and medical devices that
are cost-effective and beneficial to patients.
Promote the Development of the New Energy Industry
65.
To meet the country’s “dual carbon” targets, Hong Kong is working to achieve
carbon neutrality before 2050, in which the new energy industry will play a crucial
role.  We will expedite the application of green technologies, create quality employment
opportunities and build an influential industry chain of new quality productive forces.
Relevant measures are as follows:
(i)
We will develop a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry chain.  Major
airports and airlines in Europe, America and Asia have gradually raised their
SAF consumption targets.  The Government will work with the Mainland
authorities to enable a local enterprise, one of the world’s major SAF
suppliers, to develop its business in the GBA, covering upstream collection
of raw materials, the setting up of production plants and large-scale
production, to dovetail with the specified target SAF consumption ratio
for flights departing from the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA)
by 2030.  An SAF blending facility will also be constructed to boost the
competitiveness of our SAF industry and bolster the bargaining power of
airlines.
(ii)
The Government has made top-level planning in the Strategy of Hydrogen
Development in Hong Kong announced last year, and 28 hydrogen energy
trial projects are underway or under preparation.  These projects cover,
among other things, hydrogen buses, hydrogen street washing vehicles
and a public hydrogen filling station in the New Territories.  We will
formulate hydrogen standard certification, establish public hydrogen filling
facilities on Hong Kong Island and in Kowloon, press ahead with more trial
projects, and develop the GBA Hydrogen Corridor in collaboration with the
Guangdong Province.
(iii)
The Government is pushing forward the construction of Hong Kong’s first
large-scale electric vehicle (EV) battery recycling facility at the EcoPark,
which is expected to commence operation in the first half of 2026.  The
recycled black mass converted from locally retired batteries will be supplied
to the Mainland and neighbouring regions, promoting the development of
the EV battery recycling industry.
19
Promote the Development of the AI and Data Science Industries
66.
AI is the key driving force of a new round of scientific and technological
revolution, as well as industrial transformation.  With our advantages in scientific research,
capital, data and talent, together with abundant use cases, Hong Kong is poised to become
a global hub for AI development.  The Government will step up the promotion of AI as
a core industry for Hong Kong’s development, guided by the strategy of “strengthening
infrastructure and promoting the application-oriented approach”.  We will promote the
development of AI+ and facilitate an extensive and deep integration of AI across sectors,
with a view to achieving “industries for AI” and “AI for industries”, while placing strong
emphasis on safety risk prevention.
Promote AI Scientific Research and Leverage Our Wealth of Talents
67.
The Government has bolstered its efforts to nurture local and attract overseas
and Mainland AI professionals.  Relevant measures include setting up the AIR@InnoHK
research cluster that pooled over a thousand experts.  Combined with nearly a thousand
AI companies that have gathered in our I&T parks, this helps enhance our AI R&D
capabilities and lay the foundations for wide-ranging AI applications.
68.
The Government earlier announced the launch of the $3 billion Frontier
Technology Research Support Scheme.  It will help funded universities attract international
top-notch scientific researchers in AI and other fields to Hong Kong to spearhead basic
research in frontier technologies.  The scheme will invite applications soon.
69.
We have also earmarked $1 billion for the establishment of the Hong Kong
AI Research and Development Institute in 2026, to facilitate upstream AI R&D, the
midstream and downstream R&D outcome, and the expansion of use cases.
Mobilise Capital for AI Investment
70.
Hong Kong has developed full-fledged financing channels covering angel
investment, venture capital, private equity funds, patient capital and initial public offerings
(IPOs), effectively linking capital and quality projects around the world.  The Hong Kong
Investment Corporation Limited (HKIC), as the “patient capital” institution wholly owned
by the Government, has invested in a number of AI enterprises engaging businesses in
fields such as AI Large Language Model, cloud computing and AI drug development.  It
will continue to support the development of the AI industry through investments.
Strengthen Advantages in Data for AI
71.
Hong Kong will further capitalise on the advantages under “One Country, Two
Systems”, and promote the early establishment of a compliant and secure mechanism for
cross-boundary flow of Mainland data to Hong Kong Park for scientific research purposes,
supporting AI application testing and innovation.
20
72.
With the establishment of Cyberport’s AI Supercomputing Centre and the
Government’s launch of the AI Subsidy Scheme, we will put up for tender a site of
about 10 hectares at Sandy Ridge in the North District this year for the development of a
data facility cluster.  It will provide advanced computing power facilities, promoting the
development of data and AI-related industries.
Expand the Application of AI
73.
The development of AI must be steered by safety and driven by application.
The Government attaches great importance to the governance and risk management of
AI applications.  Information systems of the Government and public organisations must
undergo repeated testing, audits and continuous monitoring to ensure security.
74.
Meanwhile, the widespread application of AI can create greater value to our
society.  Under the leadership of the AI Efficacy Enhancement Team, the Government
will promote AI applications in government services.  The Digital Policy Office will roll
out various AI applications in respect of data analysis, customer service and document
processing, to promote extensive application in departments, while ensuring security and
controllability.
75.
Departments will also develop their own AI solutions.  Examples include
using AI to help the public make non-emergency reports to the police via voice messages
and expedite the vetting and approval of transport licences; enhance traffic management
by diverting traffic flow according to real-time data; bring convenience to members of
the public by providing an AI Assistant for users of the “iAM Smart” and the “Digital
Corporate Identity” platforms to answer enquiries and offer personalised services, as well
as to recommend suitable funding schemes and public service support for enterprise,
especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs); render carer support through an
AI chatbot to give carers more convenient access to information; improve the accuracy of
histopathological and cytological analysis by introducing digital pathology technology and
the application of AI, and enhance patient care efficiency, hospital management and service
quality by promoting the application of generative AI in clinical workflows.
76.
The Government will also promote AI business applications.  The Hong Kong
Monetary Authority (HKMA), in collaboration with Cyberport, has launched the
second cohort of the AI Sandbox initiative to promote AI applications to more financial
institutions.  In addition, the HKMA is developing an AI model evaluation approach to
step up testing on the system security of financial institutions.  The DEVB will provide
subsidies to encourage the application of AI in private sector construction works.
The Department of Justice (DoJ) will also establish an inter-departmental working group
to review the legislation needed to support a wider application of AI.
21

## Chapter V

Integrate into the Overall
National Development
77.
As the world’s second-largest economy, our country contributes more
than one-third of global economic growth, representing the greatest opportunity for
Hong Kong’s development.  We will fully integrate into the overall national development,
capitalising on national strategies such as the GBA and high-quality co-operation under
the B&R Initiative.  In addition, this year is the preparatory year for the national 15th
Five-Year Plan.  Leveraging Hong Kong’s unique advantages, we will contribute to the
national development, and deepen international exchanges and co-operation by connecting
with the Mainland and the world.  We will also attract more enterprises to use Hong Kong
to expand overseas, thereby creating business opportunities and economic returns.
(A) “Bringing in and Going Global”: Hong Kong as a
Platform for Overseas Expansion
78.
China’s external direct investment exceeded RMB 1 trillion last year,
underscoring the growing global demand for “Made in China” products.  Mainland
enterprises are accelerating their pace to “go global”.
79.
With a shift in strategic focus, Mainland enterprises are proactively exploring
emerging markets.  The Government will capitalise on the advantages of Hong Kong
as an export platform to unlock new areas for economic growth.  Mainland enterprises
going global can establish Corporate Treasury Centres (CTCs) and regional headquarters
in Hong Kong for cross-boundary settlement, remittance, financing and related functions.
They can also tap Hong Kong’s professional high value-added supply chain services in
fields such as accounting and law to help them explore overseas markets.  In addition,
they can leverage Hong Kong’s strengths in marketing to connect with global buyers and
build international brands.
80.
In last year’s Policy Address, I announced that we would develop Hong Kong
into a high value-added supply-chain service centre, attracting more enterprises to
establish a presence in Hong Kong and expanding our headquarters economy.  In 2024,
Hong Kong was home to more than 1 400 regional headquarters of non-local enterprises,
over 300 of which were from the Mainland.
81.
I will establish a one-stop platform by mobilising Hong Kong’s overseas
offices, including those under InvestHK and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council
(HKTDC), as well as Hong Kong offices in the Mainland, and set up the Task Force on
Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global (GoGlobal Task Force) to encourage
Mainland enterprises to use Hong Kong in expanding their businesses overseas.  The
22
Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development will steer the work of GoGlobal Task
Force and co-ordinate various bureaux, departments and agencies in formulating proposals
for enterprises looking to go global.  Details are as follows:
(i)
The HKMA will encourage the banking sector, especially banks in the
Mainland, to establish regional headquarters in Hong Kong, where
Hong Kong’s strengths can help them expand into markets such as
Southeast Asia and the Middle East, thereby providing more comprehensive
cross-boundary financial solutions.
(ii)
To attract more Mainland enterprises to establish CTCs in Hong Kong, we
will complete a study on tax concessionary measures to be further enhanced
in the first half of 2026.
(iii)
The HKMA has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Public
Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia to establish a US$1 billion new investment
fund, catering to enterprises in Hong Kong and other GBA cities looking to
expand into Saudi Arabia.
(iv)
The HKMA will collaborate with organisations such as the Hong Kong
Association of Banks, the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce and
the Federation of Hong Kong Industries to lead delegations of banking
representatives and SMEs to explore business opportunities in Southeast
Asian markets such as Vietnam, pooling industry strengths to support the
“going global” platform.
(v)
The Government will leverage the strengths of Hong Kong’s exhibition
industry and consolidate our position as the ideal platform for Mainland
brands to “go global” and for “bringing in” brands from around the world.
We will also support the trade to organise more events conducive to brand
development.
(vi)
We will promote the development of carbon audit services to assist
enterprises going global to meet international requirements and standards
on green trade in respect of carbon emission reduction.
82.
The Government will assist the local media to expand their network beyond
Hong Kong, telling the good stories of Hong Kong.
23
(B) Deepen International Exchanges and Co-operation
83.
We will actively invite the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to set up an
office in Hong Kong.  The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) will also
deepen co-operation with Southeast Asian exchanges, attracting Southeast Asian issuers to
seek secondary listings in Hong Kong and encouraging asset management companies to
issue products in their local markets, thereby spurring asset allocation in our market.
84.
The Belt and Road Office will co-ordinate local public organisations and
institutes to help train the personnel of B&R countries.  It will also strive for more
opportunities to match commercial projects in B&R markets with Hong Kong professional
service sectors.
85.
We support our country to promote the participation in green co-operation
with B&R countries by, among other things, jointly setting up a B&R Green Development
Co-operation Platform in Hong Kong with the B&R Initiative International Green
Development Coalition.  The Environmental Protection Department will set up a B&R
sustainable green development training centre in Hong Kong in 2026, providing training
courses for the personnel of B&R countries.  The Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC) will
support the initiative with funding of $100 million.  In addition, we will support local
professional organisations5 to promote green building assessment tools among B&R
countries.
86.
The Government will invite members of the Silk Road Maritime Association6 to
hold a summit during Hong Kong Maritime Week next year, promoting its participation in
the B&R shipping brand.
87.
This year and next, we will organise the World Internet Conference Asia-Pacific
Summit and InnoEX; the inaugural Hong Kong Fixed Income and Currency Forum;
the INTERPOL General Assembly; the GBA Conference on Inheritance, Innovation and
Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine; the Association of National Olympic
Committees General Assembly; the Asia-Pacific Association for International Education
Conference and Exhibition; and the first Research Summit of the Research Grants Council.
We will also establish the Hong Kong International Correctional Services Response Tactics
Training Academy to enhance international exchanges and professional training.  The
Government will support local universities and professional organisations in their bids
to host more international academic and professional conferences and publish influential
academic journals.  The Government will also participate in and promote I&T collaboration
with various international and regional organisations, such as the International
Organization for Standardization.
5
The Hong Kong Green Building Council and the BEAM Society.
6
The Silk Road Maritime Association was co-founded in 2018 by three large enterprises, the China COSCO
Shipping Group, the Fujian Provincial Communication Transportation Group and the Xiamen Port Holding
Group.  The association aims to build an international integrated logistics service focused on shipping and foster
economic and trade co-operation and development of countries and regions along the Maritime Silk Road.  To
date, the association has more than 330 members, including shipping companies, port enterprises, logistics
companies and trade establishments, as well as members from upstream and downstream industries such as
finance, insurance and technology.
24
(C) Development of the Greater Bay Area
88.
As one of its core cities, Hong Kong plays a vital role in driving the GBA’s
development.  It also plays an irreplaceable part in our country’s reform and opening up.
The Government will continue to lead the entire community to dovetail with national
strategies and integrate into the country’s overall development in a more proactive
manner.  We will also strengthen mutually beneficial co-operation with Guangdong and
Macao and deepen co-ordinated development.
89.
We will continue to deepen our co-operation with Guangdong and Macao,
forging closer convergence of our respective rules and mechanisms to enhance the flow of
people, goods, data and capital.  Relevant measures include:
(i)
Develop the HKIA Dongguan Logistics Park.  Upon security screening and
cargo acceptance in Dongguan, Mainland cargo can be transported directly
to the HKIA for transhipment, significantly reducing operating costs.  This
is the most successful model of GBA co-operation.  Phase 1 development’s
permanent facilities will be completed in stages, starting from the end of
this year.  The preliminary study for Phase 2 development is also set to
commence this year, including the introduction of more high value-added
logistics and cross-boundary e-commerce facilities.
(ii)
Promote a panel of GBA arbitrators and a platform for GBA commercial
mediation and arbitration to lower enterprises’ costs of cross-boundary
dispute resolution.
(iii)
Extend cross-boundary ambulance transfer arrangements with the
governments of Guangdong and Macao, including two-way ambulance
transfers and expansion to cover designated hospitals in Zhuhai and
Nansha.
(iv)
Enhance Cross-boundary Credit Referencing and the Shenzhen-Hong Kong
cross-boundary data validation platform to facilitate Hong Kong banks’
credit assessment of Mainland residents and enterprises in Hong Kong.
(v)
Continuously enhance the Payment Connect, expanding to use cases for
remittance related to people’s livelihood.  The Government will improve
disbursement arrangements for portable cash assistance next year, so that
Hong Kong elderly recipients retiring in Guangdong and Fujian Provinces
may opt to receive Government assistance directly through their bank
accounts with designated Mainland banks.
25
(vi)
Work with exchanges in the GBA to develop commodity trading, carbon
trading and other businesses.  The HKEX, a controlling shareholder of
the Qianhai Mercantile Exchange, will continue to strengthen mutual
co-operation for the development of the offshore spot soybean market.  Core
Climate, the carbon marketplace of the HKEX, will collaborate with pilot
carbon markets in the GBA to explore cross-boundary trade settlements on a
trial basis.
(vii)
Boost collaboration between the HKIC and the Guangdong Government
to help Hong Kong’s enterprises with high technology content, such as
biotech and health tech start-ups, to strengthen cross-border industry chain
development.  Nansha will be the key base for the first phase.
(viii)
The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) is working with
Shenzhen and Qianhai to promote digital finance development and support
deeper integration of technology and finance between Shenzhen and
Hong Kong.  Measures are expected to be announced later this year.
26

## Chapter VI

Consolidate Hong Kong’s Status as
an International Hub
90.
Backed by strong national support and a high degree of global connectivity,
Hong Kong is recognised worldwide as an international centre in finance, trade and
shipping, as well as in aviation, legal services and dispute resolution.  The Government
will fully leverage these institutional strengths to consolidate Hong Kong’s status as a
premier international hub.
(A) International Financial Centre
91.
Through sustained efforts of the Government to strengthen our financial
system, Hong Kong has reclaimed its third-place position in the Global Financial Centres
Index ranking.  Building on this momentum, we will harness the asset-reallocation wave
of global investors to cement our status as an international financial centre.  Our strategy
will deepen the equity market, expand a world-class bond market and a vibrant currency
market, while advancing the insurance, asset management and wealth management
sectors.  We will also expedite the development of new growth areas, building a premier
international gold trading market, driving the development of fintech, as well as
promoting green and sustainable finance.
Continuously Strengthen the Stock Market
92.
The Hong Kong stock market has maintained its strong momentum.
The Hang Seng Index has risen by over 20% year-to-date, while the average daily turnover
has reached $250 billion, nearly double that of last year.  At the end of August, the
cumulative amount of funds raised through IPOs exceeded $130 billion, nearly six times
higher than that of the same period last year, ranking Hong Kong first globally in IPO
fundraising.
93.
We will leverage the Technology Enterprises Channel to assist Mainland
technology enterprises in raising funds in Hong Kong, strengthening financial support
for our nation’s development as a science and technology powerhouse.  We will also
optimise the regimes for listing on the Main Board and issuing structured products,
consider enhancements to the listing requirements for companies with weighted voting
right structures, explore shortening the stock settlement cycle to T+1, encourage more
overseas enterprises to seek secondary listing in Hong Kong, support China Concept
Stock companies to return from overseas markets, with Hong Kong as their preferred
destination, and press ahead with the inclusion of an RMB trading counter under Stock
Connect’s Southbound trading for Hong Kong stocks.
27
Build a World-leading Bond Market
94.
The Government will further consolidate Hong Kong’s position as a bond
market hub.  Relevant measures include:
(i)
Enhance financial infrastructure, including the collaboration between
the HKMA’s CMU OmniClear and the HKEX to explore centralised
management and the cross-collateralisation of assets (such as shares
and bonds) by investors on a single platform, with a view to fostering
interplay between various mutual-market access mechanisms, establishing
connections with markets such as Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates
and promoting the use of offshore Chinese Government Bonds as collateral
in different clearing houses to further enrich the use cases of RMB assets.
The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is also studying the feasibility
of an innovative electronic bond-trading platform built and operated by
market participants.  It is also promoting the establishment of a commercial
repo market and a central counterparty regime in Hong Kong to improve
market liquidity.
(ii)
Continue discussions with relevant Mainland institutions on introducing
offshore treasury bond futures in Hong Kong, expand the variety of
interest rate derivatives under Swap Connect, promote the development of
over-the-counter derivatives, and explore the launch of the cross-boundary
RMB repo business in collaboration with the Mainland in due course.
(iii)
Step up market outreach efforts by the SFC, the HKMA and the HKEX
to encourage more enterprises to issue corporate bonds in Hong Kong,
attracting capital from around the globe to participate in our bond market.
(iv)
The SFC and the HKMA will set out relevant details of these measures in
the Fixed Income and Currency Roadmap to be published.
Build a Vibrant Currency Market
95.
Hong Kong is the world’s largest offshore RMB business hub.  To enhance
the liquidity and global reach of the offshore RMB market in Hong Kong, the HKMA
will make use of the Currency Swap Agreement with the People’s Bank of China and
introduce an RMB Business Facility, providing enterprises with the longer-term RMB
financing required for trade, daily operation and capital expenditure, so as to support the
use of RMB in the real economy.  It will also continue to explore diversified channels for
cross-boundary capital acquisition, so as to provide a stable source of RMB funds for the
market at a relatively low cost.  The HKMA will also explore measures to facilitate foreign
exchange quotations and transactions between RMB and other regional currencies in
Hong Kong.
96.
The Government will issue more RMB bonds and consider settling government
expenditure in RMB under suitable circumstances.
28
Expedite the Building of an International Gold Trading Market
97.
I have accepted the recommendations of the Working Group on Promoting
Gold Market Development.  The FSTB will implement the relevant initiatives, including:
(i)
Support the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) and financial institutions
to establish Hong Kong’s gold storage facilities, with a target gold storing
capacity of over 2 000 tonnes in three years, propelling Hong Kong into a
regional gold reserve hub.
(ii)
Encourage gold traders to set up or expand refineries in Hong Kong, and
explore with the Mainland the feasibility of processing supplied materials
in the Mainland to produce refined gold for exporting to Hong Kong for
trading and delivery.
(iii)
Establish a central clearing system for gold in Hong Kong to provide
efficient and reliable clearing services for transactions of gold in
compliance with international standards, and invite the participation of
the Shanghai Gold Exchange to prepare for mutual market access with the
Mainland in the future.
(iv)
Offer a greater variety of gold investment vehicles by assisting issuers
in issuing gold funds, and support the development of new investment
products such as tokenised gold.
(v)
Support the setting up of a trade association for the gold industry, with
a view to establishing an exchange platform with the Government and
regulators, stepping up promotional efforts and attracting more B&R clients,
while strengthening talent training.
98.
The International Board of the Shanghai Gold Exchange has set up its first
offshore delivery vault in Hong Kong and launched new contracts for delivery in
Hong Kong.  We will continue to promote co-operation between the gold markets of the
two cities.
International Risk Management Centre
99.
To encourage the participation of insurance funds in infrastructure financing,
the Government will amend the legislation next year to lower capital requirements for
infrastructure investment and provide concessions for local projects.  We will also promote
the development of exclusive captive and reinsurance business in Hong Kong, encouraging
the market to introduce more insurance products such as those related to cross-boundary
elderly care, cross-boundary driving and low-altitude economy.
29
International Asset and Wealth Management Centre
100.
Hong Kong is expected to become the world’s largest cross-boundary wealth
management centre in the next few years.  Following the launch of Cross-boundary
Wealth Management Connect 2.0 in February last year, the number of Mainland accounts
investing in Hong Kong’s wealth products has increased from 25 000 to 110 000.
101.
We will further enhance the preferential tax regimes for funds, single family
offices and carried interest to attract more funds to establish a presence in Hong Kong.
The SFC will actively promote the inclusion of real estate investment trusts (REITs) under
mutual market access to increase the liquidity of REITs in the Mainland and Hong Kong.
We will also facilitate the enhancement of the Qualified Foreign Limited Partnerships
(QFLP) mechanism, in particular by collaborating with Qianhai and Shanghai to attract
more foreign capital to the Mainland’s private capital market.  The HKIC will nurture
local private equity and hedge fund institutions with good potential through direct or
co-investment.
102.
Currently, applicants of the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme are
required to invest at least $30 million in Hong Kong.  Among such investments, the
maximum amount of investment in real estate (both residential and non-residential) to
be counted towards the scheme is $10 million.  The scheme will be enhanced, raising
the maximum amount of investment to be counted from $10 million to $15 million for
the purchase of non-residential properties with no transaction price threshold; as for the
purchase of residential properties, the investment to be counted will continue to be capped
at $10 million, but the transaction price threshold will be lowered from $50 million to
$30 million.
Steady Development of Fintech
103.
The HKMA will continue to take forward Project Ensemble7, including
encouraging commercial banks to introduce tokenised deposits, and promoting live
transactions of tokenised assets, such as the settlement of tokenised money market funds
with tokenised deposits.  It will also assist the Government in regularising the issuance
of tokenised bonds, and encourage banks to strengthen risk management through the
supervisory sandbox.
7
Project Ensemble seeks to support the development of the tokenisation market in Hong Kong.  Through sandbox
experiments, it allows industry participants to explore building the next-generation financial infrastructure with
blockchain technology in actual business scenarios.
30
104.
We are implementing a regime for stablecoin issuers and formulating legislative
proposals regarding licensing regimes for digital asset dealing and custodian service
providers.  The SFC is studying the possibility of offering a wider range of digital asset
products and services to professional investors with the prerequisite of sufficient investor
protection in place.  Meanwhile, we will step up international tax co-operation to tackle
cross-border tax evasion.  The SFC will also introduce automated reporting and data
surveillance tools to build a line of defence against risks associated with digital assets in
Hong Kong.
Development of Green and Sustainable Finance
105.
In 2022, the HKEX launched Core Climate, an international carbon trading
platform and the only voluntary carbon credit trading platform in the world offering
settlement in Hong Kong dollars and RMB.  In the future, we will deepen pilot
co-operation with the GBA carbon market, testing the means of cross-border trade
settlement, and jointly building a regional carbon market ecosystem.  Working with
relevant Mainland regulatory departments and authorities, the Government will also
study issues surrounding the country’s participation in the international carbon market,
including the formulation of voluntary carbon credit standards and methods, as well as
the registration, trading and settlement of carbon emission reduction.
(B) International Trade Centre
106.
Trading is the second-largest industry in Hong Kong after finance, contributing
15% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  Last year, the value of trade was 3.6 times that
of the GDP, ranking third in the world.  The total value of external merchandise trade also
grew strongly by 7.3%, underlining the global market’s confidence in Hong Kong as a
trade centre.
107.
As the evolving geopolitical landscape has disrupted existing supply chains, we
will actively open up new markets, promote digital trade, and support the transformation
and upgrading of SMEs.
Deepen International Economic and Trade Networks
108.
Our investment agreement negotiations with Qatar largely concluded in
mid-2025.  We will explore the signing of new investment agreements with Saudi Arabia,
Bangladesh, Egypt and Peru.  The Government will also continue to seek accession to the
Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to expand our economic and trade
network.
109.
I will establish an Economic and Trade Office (ETO) in Kuala Lumpur this year
to deepen economic and trade promotion in the Association of South East Asian Nations
(ASEAN) and neighbouring countries, and will also expand the ETO coverage to Latin
America and Central Asia.
31
Promote Digital Trade
110.
The Government will promote the digitalisation of trade to lower costs and
improve efficiency.  Relevant measures are as follows:
(i)
The HKMA will develop a roadmap for Project Cargox 8 by the end of the
year.  Through Commercial Data Interchange (CDI), and working with the
AAHK and the Port Community System, the trial project will leverage cargo
data to reduce credit costs and processing time for banks and SMEs.
(ii)
The HKMA will explore cross-boundary financial collaboration with
the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Data and other parties under Project
Ensemble, such as the application of tokenised electronic bills of lading,
as well as advancing connections with CDI and Cargox to facilitate trade
finance with the use of cargo data.
(iii)
A logistics provider will be recruited as an additional pilot participant of the
Cross-boundary Express Cargo Clearance Facilitation Arrangement (CEFA)
to enhance the efficiency of e-commerce shipment.
(iv)
The Trade Single Window will be expanded progressively to cover more
trade documents.  In parallel, the Government, together with the Mainland’s
General Administration of Customs, will work to connect the single
windows of Hong Kong and the Mainland, and explore the feasibility of
extending the existing “Single Submission for Dual Declaration” Scheme
to include other trade documents and transport modes.  In addition, the
Government will discuss the possibility of connecting the single windows
with ASEAN.
(v)
The Government will introduce a legislative proposal next year for the
digitalisation of business-to-business trade documents.
Promote Commodity Trading
111.
We will continue to follow the direction set out in the last Policy Address
to foster the development of a commodity trading ecosystem in Hong Kong.  Relevant
measures include:
(i)
Support the sector in setting up more approved warehouses, having
obtained the approval of the London Metal Exchange, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the HKEX, on the establishment of eight delivery warehouses
in Hong Kong.
8
Project Cargox is a public-private collaboration launched by the HKMA, focusing on leveraging cargo data to
streamline and enhance trade finance processes; developing digital solutions to improve accessibility to trade
finance for SMEs; and exploring connections with international data partners to facilitate the trade financing use
case for banks in Hong Kong.
32
(ii)
Provide half-rate tax concessions for commodity traders to set up businesses
in Hong Kong, driving demand for shipping and professional maritime
services.  Legislative amendments will be made in the first half of next year.
(iii)
Enhance the process of international commodity trading through financial
innovation, including testing the use of technologies like electronic bills of
lading and tokenised deposit in a collaboration between the HKMA and
Banco Central do Brazil to facilitate trade.
(iv)
Deepen connections with the Guangzhou Futures Exchange and other
commodity markets in the Mainland, contributing to the internationalisation
of our country’s commodity market.
112.
The Government will set up the Strategic Committee on Commodities, led by
the Financial Secretary.  It will bring together industry representatives with the aim of
strengthening the top-down design and long-term strategy of our commodity policy.
(C) International Shipping Centre
113.
Hong Kong is one of the busiest ports in the world.  Being a leading “catch-up
port”9 renowned for its fast customs clearance and high efficiency, underpinned by a
maritime service ecosystem with more than 1 200 companies, Hong Kong is ranked
fourth among the world’s international shipping centres.  The Government will expand
the cross-provincial freight transport network, build a commodity ecosystem, drive the
port’s green transformation and digitalisation, and better harness our advantages in high
value-added maritime services.
Establish a Comprehensive “Rail-sea-land-river” Intermodal Transport
System Connecting to the Inland Region
114.
We are actively extending Hong Kong’s cargo sources, promoting intermodal
cargo transport from the Mainland’s inland provinces and cities to international markets
through Hong Kong via rail, sea, land and river.  Currently, cargo originating from
Chongqing and Chengdu can be sent by sea-rail intermodal service to Yantian Port
in Shenzhen or Beibu Gulf in Guangxi, then transhipped to the Kwai Tsing Container
Terminals by feeders or daily liner service.  This fully leverages the complementary
strengths of the ports concerned, achieving mutual benefits.
Build an International “Partner Port” Network
115.
The Government will establish “partner port” relationships with Mainland
regions of strategic collaboration significance, as well as B&R regions, and prepare for the
development of a green shipping corridor.
9
The average length of stay of container vessels in the Hong Kong port is one day, about half the average of 1.95
days for the world’s top 20 container ports.
33
Develop a Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering Centre
116.
We will focus on the development of bunkering of fuels such as green
methanol, green ammonia and hydrogen.  Later this year, we will invite the industry to
submit expressions of interest in the development of green maritime fuel storage facilities.
We will also require all vessels providing methanol bunkering services in Hong Kong
waters to install mass flow meters to improve bunkering efficiency within next year, and
initiate a feasibility study on green ammonia and hydrogen bunkering.
117.
The Government will facilitate the trading of more green maritime fuels in
Hong Kong, and assist in the export of Mainland-produced green maritime fuel.
Develop a Digitalised Port System
118.
The Port Community System, to be launched in January next year, will provide
cargo tracking function and connect sea, land and air transport networks, bolstering trade
and capital flows digitally.
Better Harness the Strengths of High Value-added Maritime Services
119.
Vessels owned, managed or operated by Hong Kong shipowners account for
nearly 10% of the deadweight tonnage of the world’s merchant fleet.  Ships registered
in Hong Kong are governed and protected by local law.  Their operation will drive the
development of high value-added maritime services, including ship management, ship
leasing, marine insurance, maritime law and arbitration.
120.
To strengthen Hong Kong’s leading position in high value-added maritime
services, the Government will amend the Merchant Shipping (Registration) Ordinance
next year to render the registration processes more flexible and digitalised.  We will also
step up promotion of tax concessions and enhance the marine insurance business.  The
Government and the Insurance Authority (IA) are engaging the industry in establishing a
dedicated marine risk pool to enhance Hong Kong’s underwriting capacity for both local
and Mainland markets.
Propel Long-term Maritime Development Strategies
121.
The Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board, established in July this
year, assists the Government in formulating more outgoing and comprehensive overseas
and Mainland promotional strategies, as well as policies for the overall development of the
maritime industry, with key areas identified for research.
34
Support Modern Logistics Development
122.
To consolidate Hong Kong’s position as an international logistics hub, we will
release the findings of the planning study on the development of modern logistics clusters
in Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen NDA this year.  We will invite expressions of interest from
the industry next year and draw up tender conditions.
(D) International Aviation Hub
123.
Connecting with more than 200 destinations worldwide, Hong Kong saw
an increase of over 60% in the number of passenger and cargo flights over the past two
years.  We will continue to leverage the opportunities brought by the Three-Runway
System at the HKIA and increase the number of long-haul and transit routes, reinforcing
Hong Kong’s top global ranking for cargo throughput and our advantages of being the
GBA’s transit hub.
Accelerate the Expansion of Aviation Network
124.
Over the past two years, Hong Kong has expanded bilateral air services
arrangements with more than 10 aviation partners, leading to an increase in flights to
and from Australia and Turkey.  We also reached a consensus with Chile last month,
laying the foundation to establish a new air services agreement.  We will encourage local
and non-local airlines to operate more flights and work to forge more new air services
agreements and expand traffic rights with South America, Central Asia, Africa and the
Middle East as our priority target regions.
Improve the Greater Bay Area’s Intermodal Network
125.
Starting in October, we will expand exemptions from the Air Passenger
Departure Tax to include passengers travelling to Hong Kong for transit by sea or land.
The AAHK will also expand the city terminal network in the Mainland, and improve land
transport connections under “Fly-Via-Zhuhai-Hong Kong”, extending the service to more
Mainland cities.
Take Forward the Expansion of Airport City Development
126.
The construction of AsiaWorld-Expo Phase 2 has begun and is expected to be
completed in 2028.  The AAHK will invite expressions of interest in the development of
a yacht bay and its ancillary facilities early next year.  The facilities will be completed in
phases, starting in 2028.  The AAHK is also working on the creation of an ecosystem for
the arts industry, the opening of a jet fresh market for fresh gourmet products and more.
35
Consolidate Hong Kong’s Position as the World’s Top Cargo Hub
127.
The HKIA has been ranked the world’s busiest cargo airport for the 14th time
since 2010.  The AAHK will continue to leverage the advantages of the Three-Runway
System to increase cargo throughput.  In parallel, it is moving ahead with the construction
of a logistics park in Dongguan, to help boost the use of Hong Kong air cargo services for
transporting goods to and from the Mainland.
(E) International Legal and Dispute Resolution Services Centre
128.
Hong Kong maintains a robust legal system highly aligned with international
standards, and is also the only place in the world implementing a bilingual common law
system in both Chinese and English.  We will step up the promotion of legal services
in Hong Kong and deepen our mediation culture, reinforcing our positions as an
international legal hub and the Capital of Mediation.
Commence Operation of the International Organization for Mediation’s
Headquarters
129.
The International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) fulfils the mission of
using mediation as one of the peaceful means to maintain international peace and security,
as stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations.  Headquartered in Hong Kong, it
reflects the importance the Central Government attaches to Hong Kong and the confidence
of the global community in the city’s development.  It will also strengthen Hong Kong’s
positioning as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services.
130.
The Government fully supports the work of the IOMed, and will organise
international conferences, professional training, internships and other programmes to help
Hong Kong young people and legal professionals work with the IOMed, nurturing more
international mediation professionals for Hong Kong.
International Legal Hub
131.
The DoJ will construct the Hong Kong International Legal Service Building
adjacent to the IOMed headquarters.  The building will house facilities such as the
headquarters of the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy, as well as
international legal and dispute resolution services institutions.
Strengthen the Promotion of Hong Kong Legal Services
132.
The Deputy Secretary for Justice is tasked to promote Hong Kong’s legal
services and will collaborate with other professional service sectors, such as accounting
and finance, to support Mainland enterprises wishing to expand overseas.
36
Mediation Culture and Arbitration Development
133.
The Government will continue to take forward the Pilot Scheme on Sports
Dispute Resolution and the Pilot Scheme on Community Mediation.  It will also strengthen
the accreditation and disciplinary systems for the mediation profession, and step up
promotion of Hong Kong’s arbitration services, while studying the need to amend the
Arbitration Ordinance.
37

## Chapter VII   Promote the Integrated Development

of Education, Technology and Talents
134.
The integrated development of education, technology and talents is a
foundational and strategic pillar for progress in the new era.  It enables Hong Kong
to build rich talent resources, knowledge reserve, and capacities for scientific and
technological innovation, thereby enhancing our competitiveness.
(A) Build an International Education Hub
135.
With a distinctive competitive edge in post-secondary education, Hong Kong
is the only city worldwide that hosts five universities ranked among the world’s top 100.
We will accelerate construction of the Northern Metropolis University Town, promote
the “Study in Hong Kong” brand, develop universities of applied sciences (UASs), and
propel our city towards becoming an international hub for post-secondary education and
high-calibre talents.
136.
We are committed to enhancing the quality of education in Hong Kong,
fostering the all-round development of students, and providing more diverse, high-quality
learning opportunities and experiences to nurture a broad pool of competent and
knowledgeable talents.  Hong Kong boasts a high-quality primary and secondary
education system that offers diversified curricula and is highly competitive on the global
stage.  The Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (DSE) has been
recognised by 1 100 higher education institutions worldwide.  We will intensify our efforts
to promote the DSE’s international recognition, attract more outstanding teachers and
students from around the world to come to Hong Kong, and support the development
of international schools.  We will also continually enhance the professional standards
of teachers and the quality of programmes, while strengthening digital and technology
education.
Post-secondary Institutions
Relax Restrictions on Admission of Self-financing Students
137.
Universities in Hong Kong are highly popular, with a double-digit year-on-year
increase in the number of self-financing non-local applicants.  The Government currently
provides 15 000 funded places for local students.  This number will not be reduced,
ensuring the current enrolment situation of local students in subsidised programmes
remains unchanged.  On the other hand, the number of non-funded places for non-local
students to study in Hong Kong on a self-financing basis will be permitted to increase.
Starting from the 2026/27 academic year, the enrolment ceiling for self-financing non-local
students of each funded post-secondary institution will be raised from the level currently
38
equivalent to 40% of local student places to 50%; and the over-enrolment ceiling of
self-financing places of funded research postgraduate programmes will be increased from
100% to 120%.
Increase Student Hostel Supply
138.
The Government launched the Hostels in the City Scheme in July to facilitate
the market in converting existing commercial buildings (including hotels) into student
hostels by obviating the need for rezoning and allowing excessive plot ratio be retained.
Effective today, apart from cases involving the conversion of commercial buildings, cases
involving redevelopment of original commercial buildings into new student hostels can
also enjoy the facilitation measures under the scheme, including retaining excessive plot
ratio.  The Government will also earmark new sites (zoned as commercial or otherwise)
this year for building new hostels, and will invite the market to submit expressions of
interest.
Attract More International Teaching and Research Talents and Students
139.
The EDB will establish the Task Force on Study in Hong Kong, bringing
together the University Grants Committee (UGC), the Innovation, Technology and Industry
Bureau (ITIB), the Hong Kong Talent Engage (HKTE), post-secondary institutions, ETOs,
the Mainland Offices etc. to step up the promotion of higher education in Hong Kong.
Relevant measures include:
(i)
Roll out the “Hong Kong: Your World-class Campus” large-scale publicity
campaign to promote Hong Kong’s quality resources in areas such as
academic studies, scientific research and international co-operation.
(ii)
Provide funding support of $40 million by the UGC for the eight funded
universities to enhance publicity, as well as teacher and student recruitment
overseas and in the Mainland.  The EDB will also take the lead in
encouraging post-secondary institutions to organise more summer study
tours to attract non-local senior secondary school students.
(iii)
Encourage post-secondary institutions to roll out more high value-added
“Study Tour in Hong Kong” activities to promote the “Study Tour in
Hong Kong” brand.
Advance the Development of Universities of Applied Sciences
140.
The Government has granted the UAS designation to two universities,
putting into practice the principle that “every trade has its masters”.  We will encourage
UASs to deepen collaboration with leading enterprises in the Mainland and overseas,
fostering industry-education collaboration and joint promotion.  The Alliance of UASs in
Hong Kong will explore the feasibility of co-operating with leading polytechnic institutions
in Guangdong Province to jointly establish a GBA exchange platform.
39
Implement the Arrangement on Mutual Recognition of Vocational and
Professional Qualifications with the Mainland
141.
We will continue exploring with Mainland authorities the implementation of
the mutual recognition of sub-degree level qualifications between Hong Kong and the
Mainland.  This aims to facilitate cross-boundary job-seeking and the pursuit of further
studies by graduates of vocational and professional programmes in both places.
Primary and Secondary Schools
Allow Schools under the Direct Subsidy Scheme to Apply for Increasing the
Number of Non-local Students
142.
The EDB will, on a trial basis, allow schools under the Direct Subsidy Scheme
to apply for increasing the number and size of classes, expanding their intake of non-local
students with student visas to study on a self-financing mode.
Promote the International Recognition of the Diploma of Secondary Education
Examination
143.
We will promote the international recognition of the DSE to various sectors
through a range of education exhibitions and activities overseas and on the Mainland,
enabling DSE candidates to have more options for further education.
144.
The EDB will strengthen efforts to crack down on the unauthorised provision
of DSE programmes or the operation of “shell schools”.  We have set up a reporting
mechanism, conducted unannounced inspections, and further clarified the registration
arrangements for private candidates taking the DSE in the coming year.  In addition, we
will formulate the Code of Practice for Private Schools and publish the Private School List
within this year, with a view to improving the standards of school operation.
Develop International Schools
145.
The EDB has allocated two vacant school premises for international school
development.  The Government has also reserved sites in the Northern Metropolis for the
development of international schools.
146.
We encourage international schools to increase their admission quotas.  We will
also remove barriers and ease restrictions, allowing quality international schools to build
new facilities and enhance existing ones, including student boarding facilities, at their
school sites on a self-financing basis.
40
Promote Digital Education
147.
The EDB has set aside $2 billion in the Quality Education Fund (QEF) to
support digital education in primary and secondary schools and will release the Blueprint
for Digital Education in Primary and Secondary Schools in 2026.  This will encompass
strategies such as optimising the interface between primary and secondary curricula
of Information Technology and I&T education, setting out an “AI literacy” learning
framework, incorporating AI education into the core curriculum, enhancing AI training for
teachers, and introducing corporate resources.
Enhance the Quality of Teaching and Learning
148.
The QEF will introduce a new stage of the dedicated funding programme for
publicly-funded schools, under which the cumulative funding ceiling for publicly-funded
schools and eligible kindergartens will be raised to enhance the quality of education.
Schools will also be encouraged to strengthen promotion in areas such as values education,
financial education and entrepreneurial spirit through various funding programmes.
(B) International Innovation and Technology Centre
149.
With tremendous potential in technology development, Hong Kong ranks
third globally in “Technology”, in the World Digital Competitiveness Ranking.  The
Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou cluster ranks first in the 2025 Global Innovation Index
Ranking of the World’s Top 100 Innovation Clusters.  With three major I&T parks and
five key R&D institutions as the framework, we will propel I&T development, pool global
talents and make full use of Hong Kong’s R&D platform to support the development
of aerospace science and technology.  We will also promote the development of new
industrialisation, press ahead with the low-altitude economy, support people-oriented
scientific research, and facilitate leading I&T enterprises to establish a presence in our city.
Improve the Strategic Layout of Innovation and Technology Infrastructure
150.
The ITIB is taking forward the set-up of two pilot lines by the Hong Kong
Microelectronics Research and Development Institute.  Preparatory work for the
establishment of the Life and Health Technology Research Institutes and the Hong Kong
Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Institute will be completed within next
year.
41
Accelerate the Development of New Industrialisation
151.
The Government (the ITIB) will provide industry-ready use cases and adopt
the “scenario-based investment promotion” approach.  It will also facilitate leading or
influential I&T companies to develop businesses in Hong Kong.  Relevant measures
include:
(i)
Expedite the development of the third InnoHK research cluster, with the
focus on sustainable development, energy, advanced manufacturing and
materials.  The R&D centres under the cluster will be established in the first
half of 2026.
(ii)
Relax the application threshold for the New Industrialisation Acceleration
Scheme by lowering the minimum total project cost from $300 million to $150
million and providing funding on a matching basis for the employment of
relevant technical personnel, encouraging the establishment of more smart
production facilities.  We will also consider providing necessary support
measures for individual enterprises.
(iii)
Launch the I&T Industry-Oriented Fund in 2026-27.  The Government
will endeavour to channel market capital to invest in emerging and future
industries of strategic importance.
Support People-oriented Scientific Research
152.
During my visit to Hangzhou’s “Six Little Dragons” in Zhejiang, I was aware
of a new technology that enables a breakthrough benefitting people with amputations.
Prostheses incorporating new R&D technologies are embedded with sensors that can
detect neural signals transmitted from muscles to control prosthetic movements without
having to implant any device or wiring.  With some training, wearers of these prostheses
are able to perform daily activities such as writing or playing musical instruments.
The Government will support people-oriented scientific research through the Innovation
and Technology Fund to introduce prostheses built with new R&D technologies.
A two-year scheme will be introduced to grant full subsidies to amputees in Hong Kong
for the configuration and use of the high-tech prostheses free of charge, enabling them to
benefit from new technologies.
Promote the Development of a Low-altitude Economy Ecosystem
153.
The Government will forge ahead with building a competitive low-altitude
economy ecosystem, to propel Hong Kong as an Asia-Pacific hub for innovative
low-altitude applications.
42
Formulate an Action Plan
154.
We will formulate the Action Plan on Developing Low-Altitude Economy to
advance Hong Kong as a major hub for low-altitude applications through institutional
innovations and technological breakthroughs.  Relevant measures include:
(i)
Improve civil aviation legislation and regulatory framework, including
formulating dedicated legislation for unconventional aircraft weighing over
150 kilograms, to lay the foundation for developing the standardisation of
the low-altitude economy.
(ii)
Enhance core infrastructure facilities by designating spectrum by the end of
the year, as well as facilitating early planning and deployment of facilities
such as vertiports, air route networks, satellite positioning, three-dimensional
spatial data systems and a smart, low-altitude traffic-management system.
155.
We will further encourage higher education institutions and enterprises to make
use of existing funding schemes to promote relevant R&D and its applications, review
relevant talent development, and support the industry and universities in organising more
training to promote the low-altitude economy.  Last year, InvestHK hosted the inaugural
Hong Kong Low Altitude Economy Forum, attracting over 250 local and overseas industry
stakeholders.  We will continue to encourage the hosting of flagship events to showcase
the business opportunities of the low-altitude economy and an innovative, efficient and
secure low-altitude economy ecosystem.
Enhance the Regulatory Sandbox
156.
The first batch of Regulatory Sandbox pilot projects was announced in
March.  We will regularise the operation of more mature application scenarios, and roll
out the advanced low-altitude economy “Regulatory Sandbox X ” pilot projects to cover
application scenarios that are technically more complex, such as cross-boundary routes and
passenger-carrying, low-altitude aircraft.
Develop Low-altitude Economy Insurance Products
157.
The insurance industry has set up a task force to develop low-altitude economy
insurance products for various application scenarios, drawing reference from the data of
the Government’s Regulatory Sandbox.  The IA will forge closer ties with the industry to
meet demands.
43
Promote the Development of Aerospace Science and Technology and
Support Space Economy
158.
Our country has designated commercial aerospace as a strategic emerging
industry.  Hong Kong has an advantage in internationalisation and possesses strong
scientific research capabilities, with various universities participating in national aerospace
projects.  This, coupled with our financing advantages, allows us to promote the
development of aerospace science and technology, supporting the space economy.
159.
The Government has set up the Hong Kong Space Robotics and Energy Centre
under the InnoHK research clusters to support our country’s Chang’E-8 mission.  The
Innovation and Technology Support Programme Special Call on Aerospace Technology
has allocated over $100 million to support six university R&D projects.  In parallel, the
Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (CEDB) is exploring how to streamline
the vetting of licence applications for Low Earth Orbit satellites and will promote 6G
application.  The HKIC will also pursue investment in areas related to commercial
aerospace and the space economy.
(C) Regional Intellectual Property Trading Centre
Promote Intellectual Property Trading
160.
Intellectual property (IP) is a legally protected intangible asset and the
cornerstone of encouraging I&T development and creativity.  Hong Kong ranks sixth
globally on the criterion for “intellectual property rights”, an improvement of six places
since the current-term Government took office.  We will push forward measures in IP
financing, valuation and protection, and strengthen external promotion to boost IP trading.
Bolster Intellectual Property Financing
161.
The CEDB and the Intellectual Property Department (IPD) will collaborate
with the HKMA to launch an IP financing sandbox to assist pilot sectors (particularly
the technology sector) in leveraging IPs for financing with the support of the banking,
insurance, valuation, legal and other professions.
Patent Valuation Services and Subsidies
162.
Upon the official operation of the Hong Kong Technology and Innovation
Support Centre, by the end of this year, the Government will support the centre in
providing local small and medium I&T enterprises with patent evaluation based on
national standards, and launching a two-year pilot programme to subsidise patent
valuation as a reference for credit financing.
44
Protect Intellectual Property Rights
163.
Following the completion of the public consultation on enhancement of
the Copyright Ordinance regarding the protection for AI technology development in
September last year, the Government will formulate a code of practice in respect of
relevant legal principles and prepare a legislative proposal.  We are also reviewing the local
registered designs regime for consultation by the end of the year.
External Promotion
164.
The Government and the HKTDC will promote IP financing in the Business of
IP Asia Forum 2025.  The IPD will also nominate local enterprises to compete for the China
Patent Award jointly organised by the China National Intellectual Property Administration
and the World Intellectual Property Organization.
(D) Nurture Talents
165.
The Government attaches great importance to youth development.  We
will enhance the talent policy to attract technical professionals with specified skills to
Hong Kong, promote the flow of talents between the industry and academic sectors,
and strengthen the HKTE’s efforts in talent attraction and support.  This will help build
Hong Kong into an international hub for high-calibre talents.
Promote Youth Development
Youth Training and Development
166.
To better equip our young people, broaden their international horizons and
cultivate a holistic outlook, we will launch a Young Talent Training Programme.  We
will provide more opportunities for young people to participate in the internships of
international organisations and attend international conferences.  We will also introduce
a new media thematic internship programme in the Mainland, strengthen the Youth
Financial Education Programme, and launch new mediation workshops to enhance young
people’s understanding of the mediation industry.
Facilitate International and Mainland Exchanges for Local Youths
167.
The HYAB will continue to implement the HYAB Funding Scheme for
Youth Exchange in the Mainland and the HYAB Funding Scheme for International
Youth Exchange, and encourage young people from the Mainland and overseas to
visit Hong Kong on exchange.  In addition, the eight youth uniformed groups of the
Security Bureau’s disciplined and auxiliary services departments will proactively organise
international and Mainland exchange activities.
45
Foster Diverse Exchanges and Experiences through the Youth Post
168.
The Youth Post hostel10, converted from the Kai Tak Community Isolation
Facility, has commenced operation on a trial basis and will officially open this year.  Along
with providing affordable accommodation for young people from the Mainland and
overseas, the Youth Post plans to organise about 100 youth activities of different types
encompassing culture, arts, sports and other elements in its five-year operation period,
promoting exchanges between young visitors and Hong Kong youth.
Provide More Interactive Spaces for Young People
169.
The first phase of the renovation work of the new interactive space for young
people at Youth Square in Chai Wan, and the physical platform for interaction for Youth
Link members in Nam Cheong, will be completed by the end of this year, providing
venues for young people to expand their networks.
Develop a Talent Pool
Talent Admission Policies
170.
Since the implementation of an array of new talent admission policies by
the current-term Government, over 230 000 people have come to Hong Kong for work
and development.  Among the various schemes, the Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS) has
recorded an application rate as high as 55% for extension of stay.  TTPS talents granted an
extension of stay are of high-calibre.  They are mainly employed in the I&T and financial
sectors in Hong Kong.  Of them, 95% receive a monthly income higher than the local
median income of about $20,000, and 50% earn a monthly income nearly double that
amount.  This reflects a strong demand for TTPS talents and the market’s willingness to
offer higher salaries to attract them.  The TTPS contributes about $34 billion a year to the
local economy, equivalent to approximately 1.2% of our GDP.
171.
The majority of talents admitted to Hong Kong under the various schemes
are very young, with 70% of them under the age of 40, helping ease the challenges of an
ageing population.
172.
Hong Kong’s ranking in relation to global talents is rising steadily, climbing
12 places in two years to the fourth place globally this year, ranking first in the Asia Pacific
region.  This reflects that our talent policy is on the right track and effective, and is one of
the important driving forces for economic development.  The Government will continue
to implement talent policies to ensure our long-term competitiveness to drive sustained
economic growth.
10
The Youth Post project is named “Runway 1331”.
46
Strengthen Talent Exchanges among the Industry, Academic and Research
Sectors
173.
The Government will launch the Innovation and Technology Talents Exchange
Scheme for Industry and Academic Sectors, encouraging university professors to engage
in corporate R&D activities for a better grasp of industry needs.  Senior management of
technology enterprises and technical experts will also be invited to teach and help develop
curriculum, strengthening the collaborative development of our industry, academic and
research sectors.
47

## Chapter VIII  Promote the Integrated Development

of Culture, Sports and Tourism
174.
The Government will continue to advance the integrated development
of culture, sports and tourism, generating fresh economic momentum and raising
Hong Kong’s global appeal.
(A) East-meets-West Centre for International Cultural Exchange
175.
The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB) published the Blueprint for
Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development last year, setting out clear directions
for the long-term development of arts and cultural policies to consolidate Hong Kong’s
position as the East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange.  We will develop
a premium arts trading hub and promote the diverse development of the West Kowloon
Cultural District (WKCD) and local cultural and creative industries.  We will also refocus
the performance venues, develop flagship arts and cultural projects, intensify promotion
of intangible cultural heritage (ICH), and introduce commercial elements to enrich LCSD
facilities and events.
Develop a Premium Arts Trading Hub
176.
Hong Kong is among the world’s top three arts trading centres.  We will step
up our efforts to build Hong Kong into a global premium arts trading hub, attracting
more international auction houses, galleries, and professionals to establish a presence here.
Measures include:
(i)
Develop an arts ecosystem at the Airport City to host arts studios, galleries,
and dealers under one roof, supported by large-scale arts storage and related
facilities.
(ii)
Enhance our international arts trading platform by deepening collaboration
with Art Basel, thereby consolidating the position of Hong Kong as the
exclusive host city in the region.
(iii)
Engage the industry to carry out studies on taxation, financing, talent,
and related areas of arts trading to explore policy measures applicable to
Hong Kong.
48
177.
The WKCD will take forward the development of the arts trading ecosystem
and introduce the following measures next year:
(i)
Discuss leasing strategies with the developer of Artist Square Towers
to attract more arts trading enterprises, including galleries, insurance
companies, and family offices, to lease space in the towers, scheduled for
completion in 2026-27.
(ii)
Establish an international collaboration network for arts conservation, and
provide professional training and internship opportunities.
(iii)
Expand training for talents in curation, conservation, arts administration,
and other fields systematically.
Diverse Development of the West Kowloon Cultural District
178.
The WKCD is the most significant arts and cultural infrastructure investment in
Hong Kong.  The WKCD Authority will:
(i)
Organise more high-profile international events, including the second
Hong Kong International Cultural Summit and the Annual Conference 2026
of the Association of Asia Pacific Performing Arts Centres.
(ii)
Tour exhibitions overseas and in the Mainland to showcase exhibitions and
collections of M+ and Hong Kong Palace Museum.  M+ will also co-organise
exhibitions with internationally renowned museums.  More Mainland tours
of “The Impossible Trial”11 will be organised to develop the musical into a
long-running classic.
(iii)
Commission the WestK Quay at the end of this year to enhance the WKCD’s
accessibility and foster the complementary development of arts and culture,
entertainment and tourism.
(iv)
Establish the WestK Academy to provide professional training for arts and
cultural organisations and practitioners from Hong Kong, overseas, and the
Mainland.
Foster the Development of Local Cultural and Creative Industries
179.
Last year, I announced plans to develop Hong Kong into a fashion design hub
in Asia.  This year, Hong Kong Fashion Fest will promote digital fashion and sustainable
fashion in collaboration with Paris Fashion Week and Milan Fashion Week.
11
An original musical from Hong Kong commissioned by WestK and co-produced with the Hong Kong Repertory
Theatre.
49
180.
Over the past three years, films funded by the Cultural and Creative Industries
Development Agency (CCIDA) through the Film Development Fund have accounted for
nearly 30% of Hong Kong films box office receipts.  The CCIDA will enhance publicity,
exchanges, and business matching overseas and in the Mainland.
181.
The CCIDA proactively assists Hong Kong cultural and creative designers in
producing more cultural and creative products with Chinese and Hong Kong cultural
features, and in the incubation of local cultural IP.  It will continue to support the
enhancement of the Asia IP Exchange Portal, to strengthen support for local original works
to enter the Mainland and international markets.
Refocus the Performance Venues and Promote Performing Arts Mega Events
182.
With the opening of the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP), the Government has
announced the enhancement of the positioning of various performance venues.  The
Hong Kong Coliseum will be refocused to prioritise concerts, the East Kowloon Cultural
Centre will promote long-running performances and arts technology, and the Sha Tin
Town Hall Auditorium will prominently feature Cantonese opera.
Develop Signature Arts and Cultural Flagship Projects and Strengthen the
Promotion of Intangible Cultural Heritage
183.
In the past two years, the Government has developed signature arts and
cultural flagship projects to attract locals as well as tourists, including the Hong Kong
Pop Culture Festival, the Asia+ Festival, the Chinese Culture Festival, the Hong Kong
Performing Arts Expo and Hong Kong ICH Month.  The Government will continue to
strengthen the promotion of district-based ICH, promoting “ICH Around Town”.
Introduce Market-based Business Models to Enhance the Services of the
Leisure and Cultural Services Department
184.
We will introduce market-based business models into designated LCSD
facilities to provide more diverse value-added activities.  These include leasing out
museums on their closing days for commercial or private use, opening up more venues
for hire, introducing paid guided tours for visitor groups, and developing more cultural
and creative products to enhance visitor experience and operational efficacy.  We will also
explore the feasibility of engaging the market to enhance the operations of the Lei Yue
Mun Park holiday camp and selected beaches, promoting the development of recreational,
leisure, and aquatic hotspots.
50
(B) “Tourism is Everywhere”
185.
As of August this year, the overall visitor arrivals had reached 33.2 million,
a significant increase of 12% over the same period last year.  The CSTB will enhance
the development of tourism products and initiatives with local and international
characteristics, realising the motif of “tourism is everywhere”.  We will also actively
explore new visitor sources, improve visitor arrival arrangements, enhance immigration
experience, and develop the yacht economy.
Develop the Yacht Economy
186.
With 1 180 kilometres of shoreline and 263 islands, Hong Kong is
well-positioned to become a yacht hub in Asia.  We will enhance amenities for the yacht
industry and promote prime yacht tourism:
(i)
Provide approximately 600 additional yacht berths at the ex-Lamma Quarry,
the Aberdeen Typhoon Shelter expansion, and the Hung Hom Station
waterfront projects.
(ii)
Promote the development of the yacht bay at the Airport City, providing
more than 500 additional berths, including berths that can accommodate
superyachts over 80 metres in length.
(iii)
Relax the requirements for visiting yachts and develop a Dynamic Yacht
Monitoring System, allowing visiting yachts to anchor at government
designated waters and navigate in a safe and orderly manner, without
having to reserve berths at privately-operated yacht clubs or piers.
(iv)
Enhance the Electronic Business System to allow one-stop, pre-submission of
arrival information from visiting yachts for preliminary vetting by relevant
departments.
(v)
Authorise relevant Mainland organisations to conduct examinations for
local yacht masters, and offer short-term training courses to help visiting
yacht masters of visiting yachts from the Mainland obtain qualifications
for navigation in Hong Kong waters.  These measures will be extended to
visiting yachts from overseas in due course.
(vi)
Promote the systemic development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao
individual travel scheme for yachts, and co-operate with the Guangdong
Provincial Government on facilitation measures for the northbound travel
of yachts from Hong Kong and southbound travel for yachts from the
Mainland.
51
Develop “Mega Events + Tourism”
187.
We will attract visitors to extend their stay in Hong Kong and revisit again by
interweaving an array of cultural festivals, tourism projects and mega events, promoting
the development of “mega events + tourism”.
188.
Hong Kong Disneyland will upgrade its facilities upon its 20th anniversary
this year.  The Government will also continue to lead Ocean Park’s collaboration with
the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) in rolling out more themed events and products
to sustain the craze for giant pandas.  With next year being the Year of the Horse, the
HKJC will organise celebrations and performances under the theme of horse to promote
horse-racing tourism.
189.
To support the hosting of mega events, the Fire Services Department will
introduce a facilitation measure for the Temporary Place of Public Entertainment Licence
by conducting compliance inspections of fire safety requirement via video conferencing for
venues with lower safety risks.
Develop Cruise Tourism
190.
Hong Kong’s cruise tourism continues to thrive, with an anticipated increase
of about 20% this year in the number of ship calls to Hong Kong compared with last
year.  Following an ongoing review of the terms and conditions of the tenancy agreement
to boost the appeal and competitiveness of the terminal, the CSTB will begin a tender
exercise for the operator of the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal by the end of this year.
Develop “Ecology + Tourism”
191.
The Government will launch the “Four Peaks” tourism project proposed by the
Working Group on Developing Tourist Hotspots and improve facilities in country parks.
In addition, it will construct new facilities such as a tree-top adventure, an open museum
of historical relics, and novel campsites.
192.
We will also explore suitable means to connect rural attractions such as
traditional villages and fields, ancestral halls and study halls, as well as folk activities etc.,
enriching visitors’ experience of rural eco-tours through strolling and cycling.
Promote Local Thematic Immersive Tours
193.
We will develop a variety of new tourist attractions, such as promoting the red
tourism route of “Chinese Cultural Celebrities Rescue”; creating thematic floral gardens in
the 18 districts; and promoting various immersive tour projects, including Hong Kong’s
industrial brand tourism, Old Town Central, Kowloon City, Victoria Park Bazaar and the
opening of the former Yau Ma Tei Police Station for public visits.  We will also open up the
frontier closed areas at Mai Po and Starling Inlet for visitors.
52
194.
The HKTB will stage an enhanced version of the Hong Kong Wine & Dine
Festival to step up worldwide promotion of Hong Kong’s bar and restaurant offerings,
positioning the city as an international culinary hub.  We will aestheticise Lan Kwai Fong
and the surrounding streetscape in phases to foster “community-making”.  The HAD will
also refine application guidelines to facilitate the operation of home-stay lodgings and
holiday camps in rural areas.  In addition, the DEVB will facilitate the conversion of village
houses into home-stay lodgings or community eateries.
Establish Hong Kong as the Most Sought-after Destination for
Premium Visitors
195.
We will offer tailor-made luxury tours for high-spending visitors, and work
with the industry to offer sophisticated itinerary planning, concierge services, and
premium experience.
Proactively Develop the Middle East and ASEAN Tourism Markets and
Facilitate Halal Certification
196.
To further promote Muslim tourism, we will strengthen our strategy of
“accreditation, education, and promotion”, encouraging the industry to provide more
Muslim-friendly facilities and food options.  The HKTB will launch a funding scheme,
beginning today through the end of next year, by providing a half-rate certification fee
subsidy, capped at $5,000, for restaurants that have acquired Halal certification.
Enhance Immigration Experience
197.
To enhance visitors’ immigration experience, we will implement a “collaborative
inspection and joint clearance” mode at the new Huanggang Port and the Sha Tau Kok
Port under redevelopment, relax the eligibility criteria for frequent visitors wishing to
use the e-Channel service, and establish Hong Kong’s first “contactless clearance” pilot
checkpoint at the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port, which enables
immigration clearance via facial recognition technology.
198.
We will implement a new “Outstanding Services Award Scheme”, covering
various tourism service industries, to commend merchants and industry practitioners for
their outstanding products and services, and promote the hospitable culture through mass
media.
53
(C) Promote Sports Development
199.
The Government is fully committed to ensuring the successful delivery of the
15th National Games (NG) competition events in Hong Kong.  We will also promote sports
development by supporting elite sports, maintaining Hong Kong as a centre for major
international sports events, enhancing professionalism in sports, developing sports as an
industry, and promoting sports in the community.  Efforts will be made to continuously
improve the functionality and positioning of sports venues, enhance the governance of
national sports associations (NSAs), strengthen support for athletes, and step up publicity
in the community.
Ensure the Successful Delivery of the National Games
200.
Co-hosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao for the first time, the 15th
NG as well as the National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the National Special
Olympic Games (NGDSO)12 will be held in November and December 2025 respectively.
We will spare no effort in staging the competitions to be held in Hong Kong, and work
with Guangdong and Macao to make the 15th NG and NGDSO a success.  We have
collaborated with the industry to roll out various tourism products related to the Games,
and have also arranged for local free television broadcasts to relay the competitions,
allowing the public to cheer on the athletes.
Promote Synergy among Sports Venues
201.
The KTSP plays a pivotal role in promoting sports mega events and developing
sports as an industry.  We will leverage its strengths to drive “sports + mega events”
development.
202.
We will review the positioning of the Hong Kong Stadium (HKS) to
complement the KTSP and leverage the HKS’s existing facilities to support sports
development, such as serving as office space for NSAs, organising matches and related
training, and hosting large-scale sports events.
203.
To attract more world-class players to compete in Hong Kong, we have agreed
on a multi-year partnership arrangement with LIV Golf, one of the most important golf
tours in the world.
12
The 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the 9th National Special Olympic Games.
54
Enhance the Governance of National Sports Associations and Strengthen
Support for Athletes
204.
The review of the provision of direct financial support for elite athletes has
been recently completed.  The Government will continue to provide financial support
for athletes so that they can concentrate on their training within a more financially stable
context.  Training efficacy will be enhanced by capitalising on the R&D outcomes of sports
medicine.
205.
The Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China will
prioritise collaboration with NSAs that have relatively established governance frameworks,
expedite the implementation of the Code of Governance and establish a governance
paradigm.  The Government will strive to support Asian or international sports
associations to establish presence in Hong Kong through NSAs, while encouraging NSAs
to participate in the work of these associations to strengthen the city’s international voice
and influence.
55

## Chapter IX

Facilitate Stable Living in a Caring
and Inclusive Society
206.
Improving people’s livelihood is my key policy priority.  Since taking office,
the current-term Government has been striving to build a vibrant economy and promote
development.  These efforts aim to enhance our economy’s long-term competitiveness,
generate strong growth momentum, and lay a solid foundation for improving the
well-being of our people – ultimately increasing their sense of happiness and well-being.
This chapter on livelihood is the longest in the Policy Address, covering nine areas that are
closely linked to the everyday lives of Hong Kong residents.
(A) Increase Housing Supply and Enrich the Housing Ladder
207.
Safeguarding the basic housing needs of people of Hong Kong is the top
priority of our governance.  Since assuming office, I have strengthened housing protection
for the grassroots by accelerating the construction of PRH, launching the innovative
LPH and cracking down on PRH tenancy abuse.  With the supply of PRH continuously
increasing, the Government is now well positioned to further assist the grassroots
in achieving home ownership.  We will increase the supply of flats under the Home
Ownership Scheme (HOS) and the Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme
(GSH), optimise the sale and alienation restriction arrangements, help more PRH tenants
realise home ownership, while enabling the owners of subsidised sale flats (SSFs) enter
into the private housing market.  With the housing ladder enriched, we can support
residents across all walks of life to live and work happily.
Increase Public Housing Supply
208.
In the five years starting from 2026-27 onwards, the overall public housing
production (including LPH) will reach 189 000 units, about 80% higher than when I took
office.  Three years ago, PRH applicants had to wait 6.1 years on average before they were
offered PRH.  With our efforts over the past three years or so, the Composite Waiting Time
for Subsidised Rental Housing has been shortened by a whole year to 5.1 years, and we
are moving closer to the target of reducing it to 4.5 years in 2026-27.  Subdivided unit (SDU)
households can improve their living conditions by moving into PRH or LPH units one
year earlier, while saving about $36,000 or $50,000 in rent on average per year respectively.
209.
Three years ago, I announced the launch of 30 000 LPH units.  About 10 000 of
them will be completed for intake by the end of this year.  The remaining 20 000 units will
be completed in the coming year and a half.
210.
The Basic Housing Unit regulatory regime, designed to eradicate substandard
SDUs, is being scrutinised by the LegCo.  Subject to passage of the bill, the regime will be
implemented in March next year.
56
Redevelop Public Rental Housing Estates
211.
The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) will announce redevelopment
plans for Ma Tau Wai Estate and Sai Wan Estate this year.  A study will also be conducted
on the redevelopment of Model Housing Estate.
Enrich the Housing Ladder
212.
With the increase in public housing supply, we will take measured steps to help
people of Hong Kong achieve home ownership.  They include the six measures below:
(i)
Given the supply of HOS flats in the next five years is expected to be about
50% more than the five-year supply when the current-term Government
took office, opportunities for both Green Form (GF) and White Form (WF)
applicants to purchase HOS flats will increase significantly.  On the basis
that the supply of HOS flats are substantially increasing, we will increase the
ratio of quotas between GF and WF from 40:60 to 50:50 to assist more PRH
tenants to become owners, while at the same time transfer the original PRH
units to Waiting List applicants, benefitting both parties at the same time.
(ii)
To increase opportunities for WF applicants to purchase SSFs with unpaid
premium in the secondary market, the HKHA will increase the quota of the
White Form Secondary Market Scheme (WSM) by 1 000 to 7 000, starting
from the next WSM exercise.  Half of the 1 000 additional quota will be
allocated to young family and one-person applicants below 40.
(iii)
To prevent forfeiture of the WSM quota because of personal preferences,
the number of approval letters issued by the HKHA will be suitably higher
than the quota set under the WSM exercise, ensuring that the quota for flat
purchases can be fully utilised, in order to strive to meet the expectations of
the purchasers.
(iv)
We will increase the ratio of larger units in HOS and GSH projects in
response to market needs.
(v)
We will relax the alienation restriction period of new flats for sale from
15 years to 10 years to encourage upward mobility.  This measure will be
applicable starting from the next HOS and GSH sale exercises.
(vi)
We will launch the “Flat-for-Flat Scheme for Elderly Owners” of HKHA’s
SSFs, allowing those who have reached the age of 60 and owned their flat
for 10 years or more to purchase a smaller flat or a flat in a more remote
area after selling their original one in the secondary market with premium
unpaid.  In doing so, they can get additional cash to cover their living
expenses, while urban or larger flats can be released for families in need to
apply for.
57
213.
The HKHA and the Hong Kong Housing Society will introduce a pilot scheme,
allowing those who have owned an SSF for 10 years or more to let their flats with unpaid
premium to eligible WF applicants after paying relevant fees, subject to a quota of 3 000.
Private Housing Supply
214.
According to the Long Term Housing Strategy, the supply target for private
housing in the coming decade is projected to be 126 000 units.  The Government will have
sufficient land to meet the demand in the next ten years, and will roll out such land to the
market in an orderly and pragmatic manner.  Besides Government land sale, other sources
of private housing land supply include railway property development and Urban Renewal
Authority (URA) projects, as well as private development projects.
(B) Land Development
215.
The Government must maintain an ample supply of land to meet the demand
for major development projects, long-term economic development and the community’s
housing needs.  Land reserve is similar to bank savings in that both are saved for use when
needed.  We will sustain efforts to produce and retain control over the supply of land.  In
parallel, we will improve the efficiency of land production and lower construction costs
by streamlining approval processes, optimising administrative procedures, strengthening
internal collaboration, applying technology, reviewing relevant standards and more, so as
to safeguard public interests and meet development needs.
Build Land Reserve
216.
In the next decade, the Government will get ready around 2 600 hectares of
“spade-ready sites”13.  Apart from meeting the development needs, this would also provide
the necessary room for the Government to build up a healthy land reserve.
Reduce Construction Costs
217.
We will continue to streamline statutory procedures and administrative
workflows.  Relevant measures include:
(i)
Simplify works approval procedures, set clear performance pledges, and
enhance co-ordination among relevant departments on vetting processes to
expedite approval.
(ii)
The Housing Department (HD) will set up a Project Facilitation Office to
co-ordinate departments in expediting the completion of public housing
projects.  The Housing Bureau (HB) has implemented a new management
approach, under which the target time for project completion is set to
prompt the accelerated completion of various project stages.
13
“Spade-ready sites” refer to sites that have gone through procedures including rezoning, clearance and
formation, and are ready for commencement of works.
58
(iii)
Leverage technologies.  Next year, the DEVB will launch a Project Cost
Management Platform, establishing a market price database and applying
AI technology to analyse, for example, past government project cost data, to
ensure greater cost-effectiveness in future project designs.  The HD has also
adopted the self-developed Building Information Modelling (BIM)-enabled
Systematic Approach to Foundation Design, which automatically generates
designs to further reduce costs.
(iv)
The Building Technology Research Institute will continuously review
the construction standards and requirements of government projects.
In addition, regarding the approval of building materials for public housing,
the HB will look into the accreditation of standards of more regions.
(v)
The Government will relax the gross floor area (GFA) exemption
arrangement for car parks in private developments by removing the
mandatory requirement of constructing underground car parks as a
condition of exemption, and granting full GFA exemption if developers
construct no more than two storeys of above ground car parks.
(vi)
The DEVB will conduct central procurement on a trial basis in the first
half of next year, piloting in the procurement of commonly used materials
including steel reinforcement and Modular Integrated Construction
(MiC) modules, in order to save costs.  The HB will also pilot the batch
procurement of integrated modules of MiC method next year.  In addition,
the HB has established a database of standard building materials, covering
commonly used materials such as aluminium windows and partition walls,
to expedite the approval process.
Release Industrial Land in Urban Areas
218.
Since 2000, the Planning Department has conducted five rounds of Area
Assessments of Industrial Land in the Territory, and some of the industrial land have
been rezoned for other uses such as residential and business uses.  The Government will
commence a new round of study this year and put forward recommendations next year,
including the way forward for the Revitalisation Scheme for Industrial Buildings.
Urban Renewal with a New Mind-set
219.
Embracing a new mind-set, we will explore the use of newly developed land to
take forward urban renewal.  Relevant measures include:
(i)
Relax the current arrangement for the transfer of plot ratio within the
same district to allow the cross-district transfer of unutilised plot ratio from
redevelopment projects to other districts or even NDAs, to enhance market
incentives for redevelopment.
59
(ii)
Reserve three sites in Kwu Tung North and Fanling North NDAs in the
Northern Metropolis for the URA to construct new buildings, which will be
used as replacement flats under the “Flat-for-Flat” Scheme in the future.
(iii)
Suitably increase the plot ratio of private redevelopment projects, on a pilot
basis, for the seven designated areas14 with more pressing redevelopment
need, allowing the increased plot ratio to be transferred for utilisation in
the Northern Metropolis or other districts, or to be used for offsetting the
premium payable for bidding land, lease modification in other projects or
in-situ land exchange.
Enhance Construction Safety
220.
The Government will amend the Buildings Ordinance next year to enhance
the deterrent effect against non-compliance with statutory notices or orders and serious
unauthorised building works, and strengthen regulation of contractors.
(C) Enhance Transport and Commuting Convenience
Promulgate the Transport Strategy Blueprint
221.
The Transport and Logistics Bureau will publish the Transport Strategy
Blueprint by the end of this year to outline directions and specific measures for transport
development.
Smart and Green Mass Transit Systems
222.
We will soon invite tenders for the smart and green mass transit system
project in Kai Tak, and will invite tenders for the projects in East Kowloon and the Hung
Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen NDA next year.
Accelerate the Introduction of Mass Transit Systems
223.
To speed up the introduction of new mass transit systems from around the
world, the Government will devise a regulatory framework applicable to different system
technologies and operators, and introduce a bill next year.
14
The Land (Compulsory Sale for Redevelopment) (Amendment) Ordinance 2024, which came into effect last year,
specified seven areas with more pressing need for renewal based on the areas covered by the OZPs, including
Cheung Sha Wan (the same OZP covering also Sham Shui Po), Ma Tau Kok (covering Kowloon City and To Kwa
Wan), Mong Kok, Sai Ying Pun and Sheung Wan (covered by the same OZP), Tsuen Wan, Wan Chai and Yau Ma
Tei.
60
Promote Autonomous Vehicles
224.
The Government established a regulatory framework for autonomous
vehicles (AV) last year.  Three areas will be approved this year for AV trials, aiming at
AV cross-district travel and connections to other modes of transport, to accelerate the
large-scale development of driverless autonomous driving in Hong Kong, expediting its
transition to commercial operations, and facilitating the industry’s expansion to overseas,
particularly right-hand-drive markets, using Hong Kong as the platform.
Regulate Ride-hailing Services by Legislation
225.
The issue of regulating ride-hailing services in Hong Kong has persisted for
over 11 years.  The current-term Government is determined to resolve this issue, striving
to pass the legislation on regulating the services before the prorogation of the current-term
LegCo, with a view to safeguarding the public’s travel safety.
(D) Healthcare
226.
To address the challenges brought by an ageing society, increasing prevalence
of chronic diseases and pressure on healthcare resources, the Government will deepen
healthcare system reform, enhancing its sustainability, strengthening primary healthcare
and increasing healthcare manpower, while promoting health and medical innovation and
encouraging collaboration within the GBA.
Enhance the Public Healthcare System
227.
The HA will enhance the safety, quality and efficiency of public healthcare
services, uphold the safety-first principle in delivering services, and advance the reform
of governance and accountability.  Dedicated teams will be established and the electronic
systems upgraded to process applications for medical fee waivers to help patients in need.
The charges and positioning of non-subsidised services will be reviewed to offer more
service options to members of the public who can afford more.  Existing public healthcare
services will also be enhanced.  Relevant measures include establishing, in phases, Stroke
Centres and Integrated Cardiovascular Diseases Centres in accordance with national
accreditation standards to improve treatment effectiveness; shortening waiting time by
10% (about 10 weeks) for stable new case bookings in the specialty of Surgery; enhancing
ophthalmic services by strengthening training for professional personnel, introducing
innovative medications and setting up a new high-capacity ambulatory cataract surgery
centre; extending the Hospital Accreditation Programme to cover a major acute hospital
in each public hospital cluster, while contributing to the internationalisation of national
hospital accreditation standards; and comprehensively upgrading the “Degenerative Knee
Joint Management Programme” to promote early prevention and avoid progression to
late-stage conditions that require surgical treatment.
61
Healthcare Manpower Development
228.
Last year, the Policy Address announced the plan to establish a third medical
school.  Over the past year, the Task Group on New Medical School has completed an
overall assessment of the proposals prepared by expert advisors and is conducting a
detailed study of the funding arrangements and financial sustainability of the proposals.
The task group will make its final recommendation to the Government by the end of this
year.
229.
We will support the hosting of national or international medical and healthcare
conferences in Hong Kong.  The HA will also launch a Talent Chain Project to build a
collaborative platform integrating clinical services, teaching and research.
Strengthen Primary Healthcare Services
230.
The Government will enhance community healthcare and disease prevention by:
(i)
Introduce a bill within next year for the empowerment of the Primary
Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission), devising city-wide standards
for primary healthcare services, and developing multidisciplinary service
networks.
(ii)
Enhance the HA’s Family Medicine Out-patient preventive screening and
care services, increase their service capacity and regularise their current
extended service hours progressively.
(iii)
Launch the Chronic Disease Co-care Platform on a pilot basis to conduct
hepatitis B screening and promote the community drug formulary and
community pharmacy programme, to enhance the management of chronic
diseases.
(iv)
Prepare to integrate the services of Elderly Health Centres into the district
health network in phases and expand the services of three District Health
Centre Expresses, to expedite the establishment of District Health Centres
(DHCs) across all 18 districts in Hong Kong.
(v)
Bolster public and subsidised dental services by enhancing oral health
education, oral hygiene instructions and risk assessments in the community
through DHCs and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).
62
Enhance Cancer Prevention, Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment
231.
The Government will consolidate Hong Kong’s leading position in cancer
research, prevention and control, optimising services for cancer patients by:
(i)
Collaborate with the National Cancer Center.15
(ii)
Support the hosting of the World Cancer Congress 2026 in Hong Kong.
(iii)
Enhance cervical cancer screening services and expand the Pilot Scheme on
Human Papillomavirus Testing of Self-collected Samples from the Maternal
and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) under the Department of Health (DH)
to the district health network.
(iv)
Enhance cancer screening technologies through commissioning local
universities to explore the use of AI-aided lung cancer screening.
(v)
Enhance treatment efficacy and reduce side effects by expanding genetic and
related testing services.
(vi)
Leverage cancer data and biological resources to advance oncology research,
accelerate the development and translation of anticancer drugs and related
innovative therapies, speed up the evaluation and approval of innovative
anticancer drugs under “1+” mechanism, and evaluate and introduce these
drugs into the HA Drug Formulary.
(vii)
Increase the HA’s capacity of services and acquire additional medical
equipment.
Promote the Development of Chinese Medicine
232.
The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong (CMHHK) and the permanent
premises of the Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute will begin operation in
phases from December this year.  The Government will boost the promotion of Chinese
medicine (CM), contributing to the nation’s promotion of CM internationally.  Relevant
measures include:
(i)
Publish the Chinese Medicine Development Blueprint by the end of the year.
The blueprint will cover establishing a governance framework and service
system, leveraging strengths and advancing Integrated Chinese-Western
Medicine (ICWM) services, promoting scientific research and innovation,
cultural heritage and more.
15
The Government will sign a co-operation framework agreement with the National Cancer Center to deepen
collaboration in basic cancer research, screening, early diagnosis and treatment, big data application, public
education outreach and other areas.
63
(ii)
Roll out a range of CM services for special diseases by the CMHHK in its
first year, including degenerative diseases, stroke rehabilitation and other
common diseases among the elderly.
(iii)
Promote the sharing of electronic health records (eHRs) in the CM sector
through eHealth, and expand the sharable scope of eHRs on eHealth
between CM and western medicine practitioners.
(iv)
Develop ICWM services by expanding the HA’s “knee osteoarthritis”
programme to all hospital clusters, and commencing the “palliative care”
pilot programme.
Strengthen Professional Regulation of Healthcare Services
233.
The Government will strengthen the functions of the DH in regulating
healthcare facilities and healthcare professionals.  It will consult the LegCo in the first
half of next year on the implementation of the Private Healthcare Facilities Ordinance to
prohibit unauthorised premises from using certain titles or descriptions.  It will also step
up law enforcement against unlicensed persons.
Mental Health
234.
Through a strategy of identification, intervention and treatment, the
Government places great importance on the public’s mental health and has introduced
a Three-tier School-based Emergency Mechanism.  We also place equal emphasis to
prevention, which involves building families, friendships and interpersonal networks;
focusing on the development of interests and personality; and creating supportive
environments in schools and workplaces.  All these initiatives require joint efforts, bringing
together the Government, the community and families, as well as professional support and
treatment when needed.  The Government will enhance nine measures in the following
aspects:
(i)
Regularise the three-tier emergency mechanism in secondary schools and
extend it on a trial basis to Primary Four to Six students to strengthen
support for those in need.
(ii)
Utilise the Dedicated Fund for subvented welfare service organisations,
providing training to enhance school social workers’ capabilities in handling
students’ mental health issues.
64
(iii)
Step up the promotion of mental health in the community through the
4Rs Mental Health Charter16 in primary and secondary schools and the
Mental Health Workplace Charter17, encouraging more school staff to receive
training related to mental health first aid.  A “special recognition category”
will be introduced to commend schools and organisations that arrange a
specific number of staff members to receive mental health training (e.g.
mental health first aid).
(iv)
Launch the Pilot Programme on Training for Mental Health Promotion
Ambassador to mobilise and train mental health promotion ambassadors
to promote healthy lifestyles, foster resilience and establish care support
networks.
(v)
Social media has profound impacts on the mental health of children and
adolescents.  The DH will update relevant guidelines to mitigate the impact
of social media on the health of children and adolescents.
(vi)
Basic mental health programme has already been made a compulsory
subject for first-year students in some tertiary institutions, with related
support provided for students in need.  The Government will encourage
more institutions to promote mental health on campus.
(vii)
Currently, three DHCs provide free mental-health assessments and arrange
follow-up services under the Healthy Mind Pilot Project, producing
satisfactory results.  The Government will extend the project in 2026 to cover
six more DHCs, with follow-up services to be provided by practitioners
with an academic background and training in fields such as psychology or
counselling.
16
The “4Rs” in the 4Rs Mental Health Charter cover four elements and objectives for promoting mental health,
which include
(1)
Rest: Help students cultivate healthy habits from an early age including having enough rest, adequate sleep
and leisure activities.
(2)
Relaxation: Teach students to take the time to relax, take care of their mental health and practise
self-compassion.
(3)
Relationship: Strengthen the relationships among students, teachers and students, as well as parents and
children, so as to enhance their sense of connectedness; help students understand their roles and their
importance in these relationships, so as to willingly take on responsibilities and make contributions.
(4)
Resilience: Equip students to adapt to the inevitable stress and setbacks in life, and teach students to deal
with emotions, cope with stress and overcome difficulties with a positive attitude.
17
As part of the “Shall We Talk” initiative on mental health promotion and public education, the Mental Health
Workplace Charter aims to promote mental health in workplace, objectives include to promote mental well-being
at workplace including a respectful and positive environment; promote active listening and communication,
encourage help-seeking, and facilitate early identification of mental distress and timely treatment; and create an
inclusive and friendly workplace environment for colleagues with mental distress.
65
(viii)
Leverage technologies to enhance mental health services.  Initiatives include
strengthening telehealth services for psychiatric day hospitals and outreach
services to provide suitable patients with more convenient service options,
and enhancing the text counselling platform for online emotional support
and the Cyber Youth Support Teams of the Social Welfare Department (SWD)
by strengthening AI application for more precise identification of high-risk
targets in need of support.
(ix)
Complete the formulation of the stepped care model on mental health by
the end of this year, setting out the roles of mental health professionals and
stakeholders, as well as their division of work in mental health services,
enhancing training to raise professionals’ awareness of making referrals, and
establishing the referral mechanism.
(E) Green and Low-carbon Living Environment
Develop Hong Kong into a Demonstration Base for Green Technology
235.
We will promote the commercialisation of green I&T outcomes.  Relevant
measures include supporting the market development of technologies for battery-swapping
EVs and automated battery-swapping stations, encouraging the construction of district
cooling systems by non-government entities, and driving the market to accelerate carbon
reduction in existing buildings.
Enhance Charging Networks for Electric Vehicles
236.
We have launched a $300 million Fast Charger Incentive Scheme, with an
additional 3 000 fast chargers to be provided by the end of 2028.  The Government also
plans to roll out six sites for the provision of fast charging stations, while bus operators
will open up their charging facilities for use by other vehicles.
Reduce and Recycle Waste to Achieve “Zero Landfill”
237.
The disposal rate of municipal solid waste has been declining for the past
three years.  The Government will continue to optimise service hours and locations of
GREEN@COMMUNITY facilities, support recycling initiatives in residential buildings,
and promote waste separation in PRH estates.  The Government continues to increase the
number of food waste smart recycling bins and collection facilities in residential areas this
year, working towards the goal of “one bin per block” in PRH estates.
66
238.
I·PARK118 will progressively begin operation by the end of this year.  To
expand our waste-to-energy capacity, the Government will seek funding approval from
the LegCo next year for the construction of I·PARK2.  Hong Kong’s first modern recycled
paper-pulping facility, located at EcoPark, will begin trial operation by the end of this year.
Jointly Develop the Greater Bay Area into a Beautiful Bay Area
239.
Hong Kong will take part in developing the GBA into an international,
first-class beautiful bay area, with Victoria Harbour as the core for development together
with Mirs Bay and Port Shelter.  We will take forward measures on the prevention and
control of nearshore pollution, co-ordinated protection of ecosystems and shoreline
remediation to support the initiative of developing Beautiful Bays19 advocated in our
country’s 14th Five-Year Plan.
(F) Support the Local Economy
Support Small and Medium Enterprises
240.
Hong Kong is home to some 360 000 SMEs, and they are the pillars of
our economic development.  To better cope with the city’s economic restructuring,
the Government will introduce the following 11 measures to enhance support for SMEs:
(i)
Extend the application period for the 80% Guarantee Product under the SME
Financing Guarantee Scheme for two years, and further extend the principal
moratorium arrangement for one year.  The Government will also encourage
banks to continue to adopt an accommodating and more flexible approach
when processing loans by enterprises with sound repayment ability.
(ii)
Provide concessions of fees and charges to alleviate pressure on business
operations.  The Government will reduce water and sewage charges for
non-domestic accounts by 50%, subject to a monthly ceiling of $10,000 and
$5,000 respectively per account.  About 260 000 non-domestic accounts
are expected to benefit from the measure.  We will also reduce the trade
effluent surcharge by 50%, which is expected to benefit about 35 000
businesses mainly in the catering industry.  In addition, fees for the first
issue or renewal of licences and permits, including those for hawkers, food
18
I·PARK1 and I·PARK2, located on an artificial island off Shek Kwu Chau and at Tsang Tsui, Tuen Mun
respectively, are waste-to-energy (electric energy) facilities, generating electricity by processing municipal solid
waste.
19
The development of Beautiful Bays is an important means of marine ecological environment protection for our
country and an integral part of building a Beautiful China in the maritime area.  “Pristine water and beaches,
thriving marine life, and harmonious co-existence between humans and the sea” is the aim of the overall
enhancement in ecological environment quality.  It is being realised through actions such as improvements in
quality and effectiveness, the rehabilitation of ecosystems and the remediation of effluent discharge outlets,
striving to transform 283 marine bays throughout China into beautiful bays by 2035.
67
businesses, agriculture and fisheries industries and liquor licences20 will
be waived, which is expected to benefit over 60 000 licensees.  The above
measures will be implemented for one year.
(iii)
Considering that the original estimate for the Government’s average annual
capital works expenditure in the coming five years was about $120 billion,
we will earmark an additional $30 billion in the next two to three years
to increase expenditure on works projects driving sustained economic
development, to support the local construction industry.
(iv)
In streamlining the restaurant licensing regime, new operators with
provisional licences are currently allowed to begin business while seeking
to complete their formal licence application.  Such arrangement of “licence
first, inspection later” has further expedited approval procedures whereas
simplified administrative procedures have enabled new operators of
restaurants that have changed hands to start business even sooner.
To further expedite the approval process of applications for outside seating
accommodation (OSA) of restaurants, the Food and Environmental Hygiene
Department will adopt a new way by  proactively co-ordinating various
relevant departments to undergo “joint-vetting” to resolve the matter
together, and when necessary, escalate the process regarding complicated
applications to the relevant Permanent Secretary or even the Deputy Chief
Secretary for Administration for steer; at the same time, the procedures
will be streamlined, including adopting standardised Government rent for
OSA, and allowing some applications to proceed without the requirement
for increasing kitchen area and bathroom facilities.  As for applications
involving walkways with a remaining width of three metres or more after
the provision of OSA, they will generally be considered as meeting the basic
traffic requirements and do not have to be reviewed case-by-case.
(v)
Inject $1.43 billion into the BUD Fund21 and expand its geographical scope to
cover eight more economies, including B&R countries.  We will also enhance
promotion and facilitate the participation of companies in exhibitions and
export marketing activities through “Easy BUD”.
(vi)
Increase financing support for local e-commerce businesses and expanding
the coverage of free buyer credit checks through the Hong Kong Export
Credit Insurance Corporation.
20
Food business licences, including provisional ones (if applicable), cover the General Restaurant Licence, the Light
Refreshment Restaurant Licence, the Marine Restaurant Licence, the Bakery Licence, the Cold Store Licence, the
Factory Canteen Licence, the Food Factory Licence, the Fresh Provision Shop Licence, the Frozen Confection
Factory Licence, the Milk Factory Licence, the Siu Mei and Lo Mei Shop Licence, the Restricted Food Permit and
the Composite Restricted Foods Permit.  As for licences related to the agriculture and fisheries industries, they
include the Marine Fish Culture Licence and the Livestock Keeping Licence.
21
Referring to the Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales.
68
(vii)
Set up the “Economic and Trade Express”, joining the efforts of ETOs and
overseas offices of InvestHK and the HKTDC to form a functional platform,
encouraging local SMEs and start-ups to conduct more overseas visits
exploring business opportunities, while bringing in more enterprises to
invest in and establish businesses in Hong Kong.
(viii)
Enhance Cyberport’s Digital Transformation Support Pilot Programme to
provide SMEs with subsidies, on a matching basis, to empower enterprises
to apply AI and cybersecurity solutions, boosting their competitiveness and
information security.
(ix)
Support the continued organisation of the Hong Kong Shopping Festival,
covering the Mainland and ASEAN e-commerce markets over the next three
years to promote Hong Kong brands.
(x)
Strengthen training and information services through the four SME centres,
the Mentorship Programme of the Trade and Industry Department and
the E-Commerce Express under the HKTDC.  We will also implement
the “Creativity • E-commerce – Beyond Limits” programme and provide
one-stop business matching and referral services to strengthen the interface
between Hong Kong enterprises and e-commerce service providers,
enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong products on cross-border
e-commerce platforms.
(xi)
Launch a two-year pilot scheme to support local small and medium I&T
enterprises with patent evaluation.22
Economic Diversification
Develop the Food Industry
241.
As a brand, “Food from Hong Kong” enjoys a good reputation.  Apart from
facilitating the sale of such food to the Mainland, the Government has also reserved land
near the Heung Yuen Wai Boundary Control Point to promote the food industry, including
wholesale, processing and trading.  In the long run, it may develop into a food industrial
park to promote “food production + tourism”.
242.
The Government will strengthen the competitiveness of local produce,
introducing a unified brand for local agricultural and fisheries products in mid-2026 to
enhance product awareness and brand value.
22
The relevant measure is also stipulated under Chapter VII “(C) Regional Intellectual Property Trading Centre”.
69
Promote the Development of the Agriculture and Fisheries Industries
243.
The marine economy has enormous potential, and fisheries is among its
components.  The Government will issue culture licenses for new fish culture zones and
provide deep-sea cages for rental by the fisheries industry, to increase local mariculture
production by tenfold within 15 years.  Modernised aquaculture will also be promoted.
244.
The Government will facilitate the livestock sector to construct the first
environmentally-friendly, multi-storey pig farm, in Lo Wu.  It will also take forward the
Agricultural Park Phase 2 development, and promote leisure farming and fisheries.
Promote a Pet-friendly Culture
245.
According to government statistics, more than 240 000 households in
Hong Kong keep more than 400 000 cats and dogs as pets, generating an enormous
consumption market, including food and products, healthcare, insurance, grooming,
training and more.  In recent years, the business sector and transport operators have
developed pet-friendly premises and travel arrangements.  The Government supports the
business sector in offering pet-friendly spaces to create new opportunities.
246.
The Government will introduce a licensing arrangement allowing operators to
let dogs enter their food premises.  Clear signage will be put up by permitted restaurants,
so that customers know dogs are allowed.  Pet-friendly restaurants will create new
business opportunities for the industry.
(G) Labour Support and Protection
247.
In the face of accelerated industrial transformation and ever-evolving
technological development, our workforce must continuously acquire new skills to stay
abreast of economic development and seize emerging opportunities.  We will ensure the
employment priority of local workers and combat illegal employment rigorously.  To
enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s workforce and enlarge the talent pool, we
will reform the Employees Retraining Board (ERB) and optimise the Re-employment
Allowance Pilot Scheme.  We will also strengthen labour protection, including protecting
digital platform workers, and enhancing occupational safety and health (OSH).
Ensure Employment Priority of Local Workers
248.
As our population continues to age, Hong Kong faces a declining labour
force.  Importing labour on an appropriate scale helps ease manpower shortages and
serves Hong Kong’s overall interests.  We will launch measures to ensure the employment
priority of local workers and combat the abuse of the Enhanced Supplementary Labour
Scheme (ESLS).  Starting tomorrow, when applying to import waiters/waitresses and
junior cooks under the ESLS, employers are required to:
70
(i)
Extend the local recruitment process from four weeks to six weeks, during
which they must once a week attend an on-site job fair organised by the
Labour Department (LD).
(ii)
Implement the manning ratio requirement23 more stringently such that it
is calculated based on posts being applied for, but not on all posts engaged
by an employer.  In other words, an employer applying to import a waiter/
waitress and a junior cook must have already employed two local full-time
waiters/waitresses and two local full-time junior cooks.
249.
The above measures aim to combat abuse in a targeted manner, focusing on
job categories with more imported workers, while ensuring businesses with genuine
difficulties in local recruitment are allowed to import supplementary labour in an orderly
manner to avoid business closures and collateral damage to existing employees.
250.
In addition, the Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB) has just begun a mid-term
update of the Manpower Projection with focus on analysing data of industries with a
larger number of imported labour.  The update will be completed in 2026.  The LWB will
accord priority to analysing the relevant data, and provide its findings on relevant parts in
advance.
Enhance Actions to Combat Illegal Employment
251.
The Government will step up efforts to combat illegal employment, establish
a dedicated hotline for reporting illegal workers, and strengthen intelligence collection
and inter-departmental joint enforcement operations to safeguard the employment
opportunities of local workers.
Reform the Employees Retraining Board and Strengthen Local Skills
Training
252.
In the last Policy Address, I announced the reform of the ERB.  The aim is
to assist members of the workforce, from all backgrounds and educational attainments,
to enhance their skills and competitiveness on a continuous basis, to meet the needs of
economic and industrial development in Hong Kong.
253.
Since early this year, the ERB has enhanced such services as training and career
planning, and outlined an initial reform roadmap for the next three years.  The ERB will
strengthen its industry consultative mechanism, and identify demand for and gaps in core
skills in a targeted manner to devise a skills-based training framework.  It will collaborate
with higher education institutions and guide other training bodies in developing courses
of various types and levels to fill the skill gaps.  In future, the ERB will also launch
micro-credential courses recognised by industries to offer greater flexibility to trainees, and
23
The ratio of full-time local employees to imported workers is 2:1.
71
make good use of technology to offer diversified and flexible modes of learning.  When
the ERB finalises the full implementation by the end of this year, the Government will
amend the Employees Retraining Ordinance accordingly.
Optimise the Re-employment Allowance Pilot Scheme
254.
The LD launched the three-year Re-employment Allowance Pilot Scheme in July
last year.  The scheme has been well-received, with over 50 000 participants and more than
27 000 placements recorded as of August this year.  The LD will continue to collect and
collate information and data on the participants and placements of the scheme, conducting a
mid-term review in the first quarter of next year, along with the Employment Programme
for the Elderly and Middle-aged, to explore measures promoting silver employment.
Set the First Minimum Wage Rate According to the New Annual Review
Mechanism
255.
The Government has agreed to the new mechanism of adopting a formula for
implementing the annual review of the Statutory Minimum Wage (SMW) rate proposed by
the Minimum Wage Commission.  The first SMW rate derived under the new mechanism
is expected to take effect on 1 May 2026.
Protect Digital Platform Workers
256.
The prevalence of digital platforms, such as those providing food and goods
delivery services, has brought convenience to the public and created job opportunities.  The
Government will improve the work injury compensation mechanism for digital platform
workers through legislation, and continue to make good use of the Tripartite Committee
for the Digital Platform Industry to discuss issues of concern to the stakeholders.
Enhance Occupational Safety and Health
257.
We saw a 30% drop in the number of fatal construction accidents in
2024 compared with 2023.  The LD will continue to step up inspection and enforcement,
promotion and publicity, as well as education and training, to build a stronger OSH culture
and reduce accidents.  The department will also make good use of innovative technologies
and AI, such as using drones to enhance inspection and evidence collection, and support
the industry in developing technology products that enhance OSH.
72
(H) Social Welfare
Targeted Poverty Alleviation
258.
The Government will continue its work on targeted poverty alleviation by
directing resources to those most in need.  Relevant measures include:
(i)
Enrich activities of the Strive and Rise Alumni Club with $10 million
funding from the HKJC, providing young people with training and
experience that integrate Hong Kong pop culture and traditional Chinese
arts; and inject $180 million into the Child Development Fund to continue
implementing projects promoting the long-term development of upper
primary students from disadvantaged communities, and further enhance
different elements of the projects by drawing on the successful experience of
the Strive and Rise Programme, with a view to reducing intergenerational
poverty.
(ii)
Set up six additional Community Living Rooms (CLRs).  Together with the
nine CLRs already launched, they are expected to benefit about 7 000 SDU
households, serving over 1.4 million attendances.
(iii)
Enhance the School-based After School Care Service Scheme by uncapping
the number of places to expand support for primary students and parents in
need.
(iv)
Roll out the “Co-build a Caring Society Funding Scheme” to encourage
family offices involved in philanthropic endeavours to provide resources
implementing projects that benefit the disadvantaged groups.
(v)
Provide time-limited cash incentives, on a pilot basis, for households leaving
the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) Scheme and eligible
for the Working Family Allowance, to promote self-reliance.
(vi)
Publish the Report on Impact of Targeted Poverty Alleviation Strategy in
Hong Kong in mid-2026.
Care for the Elderly
259.
The Government will continue to adhere to the principle of promoting
“ageing in place as the core, with institutional care as back-up”.  Eleven measures will be
introduced:
73
Ageing in Place
(i)
Increase the total number of Community Care Service Vouchers for the
Elderly by 4 000 to 16 000.
(ii)
Set up three new Neighbourhood Elderly Centres to strengthen support at
the district level.  They are expected to serve some 3 000 elderly persons
annually.
(iii)
Lease out newly built government welfare facilities on a pilot basis to allow
service operators greater flexibility in offering day care and support services
for the elderly under different funding modes.
(iv)
Enhance the Integrated Discharge Support Programme for Elderly Patients
to provide social welfare service support for discharged elderly persons in
need.
Strengthen Residential Care Services
(v)
Provide about 700 new subsidised residential care service places.
(vi)
Increase the total number of Residential Care Service Vouchers for the
Elderly by 1 000 to 7 000.
(vii)
Subsidise eligible serving health workers of residential care homes to enrol
in the new professional diploma programme for Health&Care Practitioners,
nurturing dedicated professionals and promoting the development of the
sector.
Enhance Elderly Care Arrangements in the Greater Bay Area
(viii)
Launch a pilot scheme by the end of this year to subsidise elderly CSSA
recipients choosing to retire in Guangdong to reside in designated residential
care homes for the elderly (RCHEs) in the province, thereby enhancing their
quality of life.  Each eligible elderly person will receive a monthly subsidy
of $5,000, subject to a quota of 1 000.
(ix)
Expand continuously the Residential Care Services Scheme in Guangdong.
Starting from October, the number of Mainland RCHEs participating in the
scheme will increase from 15 to 24, while the number of cities covered will
increase from six to eight.
(x)
Launch a two-year pilot arrangement by the end of this year to share part of
the medical expenses that Hong Kong elderly participants of the Residential
Care Services Scheme in Guangdong need to bear on their own under the
National Basic Medical Insurance Policy.
74
(xi)
Facilitate Hong Kong elderly recipients retiring in Guangdong and Fujian
Provinces by providing the option to receive Government assistance directly
through their bank accounts with designated Mainland banks.24
Support Carers
260.
Carers play an important role in supporting elderly persons and persons with
disabilities (PWDs).  When carers are provided with appropriate support to alleviate
physical and mental stress, they are better able to take care of elderly persons and PWDs.
Current measures include providing allowance for carers from low-income families,
enhancing respite services to give carers a break, setting up a 24-hour hotline manned
by social workers, launching a one-stop information gateway, and organising large-scale
publicity and public education activities.
261.
The Government will earmark an annual recurrent expenditure of $500 million
to roll out a series of measures to enhance support for carers, including:
(i)
The Government has launched the first phase of the Carer Support Data
Platform, which initially connects the data of the SWD, the HA and
the HKHA, and progressively connect the data of more government
departments and public organisations to expand the Carer Support Data
Platform.
(ii)
Upon learning from the HA that a high-risk carer has been hospitalised,
the SWD will arrange outreach to the care recipients and offer emergency
support according to their needs.
(iii)
We have consolidated the data of the HKHA and the SWD to identify
high-risk carers of elderly persons and carers of PWDs, as well as singleton
or doubleton elderly households lacking sufficient community support, and
deploy Care Teams to conduct visits.
(iv)
We will continue implementing the District Services and Community
Care Teams – Scheme on Supporting Elderly and Carers for three years
by inviting Care Teams to actively provide support for and pay visit to
high-risk families, and assisting households referred by Care Teams in
installing and using the emergency alarm system as necessary.
(v)
We will install an intelligent accident detection system for 300 high-risk
households.
(vi)
We will continue the implementation of the Support for Carers Project
for three years, with a view to providing training for frontline property
management personnel in assisting carers in need.
24
The relevant measure is also stipulated under Chapter V “(C) Development of the GBA”.
75
(vii)
We will enhance the existing AI chatbot function of the Information
Gateway for Carers.
Support Persons in Rehabilitation
Formulate Guidelines on Rehabilitation Products
262.
The Government will collaborate with university teams to formulate guidelines
for consumers of rehabilitation products, with electric wheelchairs, electric smart beds,
and robotic exoskeletons as pilot items.  The guidelines will set out basic technical and
operational requirements of rehabilitation products, to assist the elderly, PWDs and their
carers in selecting suitable products.
Provide Additional Rehabilitation Services for Persons with Disabilities
263.
The Government will strengthen rehabilitation services for PWDs by adding
80 places under the Bought Place Scheme for Private Residential Care Homes for PWDs,
220 places at Special Child Care Centres, 100 places at Day Activity Centres (DACs), and
50 places at Hostels for Severely Mentally Handicapped Persons.
Expand Support for Ageing Persons with Disabilities
264.
Ageing PWDs face additional challenges in their daily life.  The Government
will, starting from the second quarter of 2026, progressively introduce one-stop support
and care services at hostels for severely and moderately mentally handicapped persons,
and increase the number of extended care places at hostels co-located with DACs/
integrated vocational rehabilitation services centres.  These measures will release about
700 day rehabilitation training places, providing day training for PWDs living in the
community and alleviating the pressure on carers.
(I) Social Development
Establish a Working Group on Ageing Society Strategies
265.
The Government is committed to building an elderly-friendly society.
Established following the last Policy Address, the Working Group on Promoting Silver
Economy announced 30 measures in May.  The Government will collaborate with the
Federation of Hong Kong Industries to formulate the “Silver Q-Mark”, and with the trade
to consider setting additional GBA Standards for silver products to facilitate the provision
of more options for the elderly.
266.
Ageing is a global issue.  By 2046, people aged 65 and above will account for 36%
of our total population.  To tackle challenges of an ageing society, the Government will
set up a Working Group on Ageing Society Strategies under the steer of the Deputy Chief
Secretary for Administration to co-ordinate the efforts of various bureaux in formulating
the relevant strategy responses.  Aside from covering areas such as elderly care, healthcare,
76
housing, culture and leisure, and gerontechnology, the working group will consider
promoting the further development of silver economy.  The working group will take into
account the views of the Elderly Commission, and submit a report next year.
Promote Women’s Development
267.
We will increase the annual funding of the Women Empowerment Fund from
$20 million to $30 million to subsidise women’s organisations and NGOs launching
projects that promote women’s development.  The Government will also host the second
Family and Women Development Summit Hong Kong next year.
Promote Fertility
268.
On childbirth policy, the current-term Government has shifted from the
non-interventionist approach adopted by the Government of the previous terms to the
multi-pronged policy approach launched in 2023 to promote fertility.  We have introduced
various tax concessions, including raising the tax deduction ceiling for home loan interest
or domestic rents, introducing a new tax deduction for the medical expenses of assisted
reproductive services, and increasing the basic child allowance and additional child
allowance in the year of birth.  We have also implemented various support measures,
including launching the Families with Newborns Allocation Priority Scheme to shorten
the waiting time by one year for PRH applicants with newborns, introducing the Families
with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme, providing additional places for child care
services, extending the After School Care Programme for Pre-primary Children to all
18 districts in Hong Kong, and introducing the Newborn Baby Bonus of $20,000.
269.
At the end of August, more than 5 300 PRH applications had their waiting time
reduced by one year under the Families with Newborns Allocation Priority Scheme.  In the
recent HOS sale exercise with flat selection concluded in August, over 800 families with
newborns purchased their flats under the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority
Scheme.
270.
The number of newborn babies has decreased for six consecutive years since
2017, but there was an upward trend in 2023 and 2024.  In 2024, there was a significant
increase in the number of newborns, a year-on-year increase of about 3 500 babies, or
about 11%, adding up to 36 700 babies born in total.
271.
We will implement further measures under the multi-pronged policy approach
to promote fertility.  They include:
(i)
Extend the claim period of additional child allowance for newborns from
one year to two years.  Starting from the year of assessment 2026/27, a
taxpayer may claim twice the allowance (i.e. $260,000) for each child in
the first two years following childbirth.  This measure is applicable to all
children under the age of two by the end of the year of assessment.
77
(ii)
Further enhance infant and child day care service.  Fifteen new aided child
care centres (CCCs) will be set up over the next three years to provide
about 1 500 day care service places for children between birth and three
years old, almost doubling the existing supply.  The SWD will also allocate
more care-service places for infants and toddlers from birth to two years, as
appropriate.
(iii)
Enhance the School-based After School Care Service Scheme within this
school year by removing the cap on the number of places to make it easier
for parents to take up jobs.
(iv)
Set up dedicated counters for pregnant women to facilitate their waiting
for medical services.  The PHC Commission will, together with the Family
Planning Association of Hong Kong, the MCHCs under the DH, as well
as the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Departments of the HA, enhance
health education and services for women during pre-pregnancy, as well as
antenatal and postnatal stages, providing them with practical information.
(v)
Support assisted reproductive services.  The Council on Human
Reproductive Technology has made amendments to the legislation,
removing the statutory storage periods of gametes and embryos for own
use, offering greater flexibility to people who wish to give birth.  The
amendments will take effect from this December.  Moreover, the HA will
continue to increase the service quota for assisted reproductive service from
1 100 treatment cycles two years ago to 1 500 treatment cycles in 2025-26.
(vi)
Foster a family-friendly culture.  We will continue to encourage more
employers, through the Good Employer Charter25, to adopt family-friendly
employment practices that are conducive to childcare, such as flexible
working hours.
Protect Children and Provide Support for Students
Strengthen Family Cohesion and Safeguard Children
272.
The Government will set up an Integrated Family Service Centre in Kwu Tung
North NDA in the Northern Metropolis, to support families and children in the area.
In addition, we will support and educate divorced/separated parents to collaborate in
shouldering continuous and joint parental responsibilities in raising their children.  We will
also offer transitional support to young people who no longer receive residential child-care
services but lack family support.
273.
To complement the implementation of the Mandatory Reporting of Child
Abuse Ordinance, the Government has promulgated the Guide for Mandated Reporters
to assist mandated reporters in mastering child protection principles, and will continue to
25
Signatories of the Good Employer Charter have to pledge to be an employee-oriented employer and have
adopted the good human resource management practices.
78
provide training and relevant resources for specified professionals from the social welfare,
education and healthcare sectors.  The EDB will also step up promotion of positive
parenting education.
Enhance Support for Children with Special Needs
274.
For children with special needs receiving On-site Pre-school Rehabilitation
Services, the Government will provide bridging and support services during their first
term in primary school.
Provide Support for Ethnic Minorities
275.
Ethnic minorities (EMs) are important members of the Hong Kong community.
The Government has been striving to support EMs on various fronts, including
Chinese-language learning, daily living and community integration.
Strengthen Support for Ethnic Minorities’ Integration into the Community
276.
The HAD will set up one additional EM Care Team under the Support
Service Centres, serving the North and Islands Districts respectively.  The department
will also establish a Youth Network and a Women’s Network at the 10 Support Service
Centres for EMs to organise activities specifically for EM youth and women.  Moreover,
the Government will set up an additional Interpretation and Translation Service Centre
for EMs in December.  We will also strengthen the promotion of messages and radio
programmes related to racial integration.  In addition, the Health Bureau will also take
forward the pilot project of providing emotional support and counselling services for EMs
through a service centre.
Employment of Ethnic Minorities
277.
We will continue to implement the government department internship
programme for EM post-secondary students and will provide basic workplace Chinese
training.  Government departments may design their own job-oriented language tests to
provide an additional channel for applicants to meet language-proficiency appointments.
We will also disseminate government recruitment information to EMs on an ongoing basis,
to attract talents from different backgrounds to join the civil service.
Provide Support for Non-Chinese Speaking Students
278.
The Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi Chinese Proficiency Test learning materials,
tailored for non-Chinese speaking students, will be extended from the upper primary
level to the junior secondary level in the 2026/27 school year.  We will also continue to
provide after-school Chinese language courses and organise cross-school, teacher-learning
communities.
79
Continuously Enhance Care Team Services
279.
Care Teams across 18 districts will soon begin their second term of service.
Having regard to district needs, we have set up three additional Care Teams and revised
the KPIs for the second term of service.  To enable Care Teams to continuously enhance
their services, the Government has increased the subsidy by 50%, in accordance with
last year’s Policy Address, and provided these voluntary Care Teams with additional
administrative support, including hiring administrative staff.  As for emergency support,
we will enhance training so that Care Teams can continue to strengthen ties with
government departments, public utilities and district organisations.
Improve Building Management
280.
To improve building management, the HAD will implement a number
of measures, including establishing working groups under DCs to share experience;
expanding the Pilot Scheme on Joint Property Management to other districts based on its
effectiveness; and reviewing the Building Management Ordinance.
281.
We will enhance the inspection and testing procedures for handling water
seepage problems by utilising technology to expedite the identification of the seepage
situation and delineate the responsibility, requiring owners to inspect and rectify within
a specified time, or else the Government will take further action and recover costs from
owners.  This will prompt owners to fulfil their obligations in properly maintaining their
properties.  We will also actively promote mediation to resolve disputes between residents.
An Internet of Things fire detection system will also be introduced in old buildings to
replace traditional fire service installations and equipment.

## Chapter X

Closing Remarks
282.
Today, Hong Kong is at the critical juncture of advancing from stability to
prosperity.  We are moving through an irreversible economic transition, but it is an
essential process for a stronger and more robust economy in the future.
283.
Over the decades, Hong Kong has undergone multiple economic transitions.
Once, the bustling Sheung Wan night market (the “Dai-tat-dei”) sold paraffin lamps
that were a big business until modern malls made them unnecessary.  Bustling factories
that once competed for female labour have since relocated their production lines to the
Mainland, opening new horizons for the manufacturers.  Pagers, once a common sight in
every hand, have been replaced by smartphones, leaving behind empty pager shops as
relics of a past era.  Each change brought about a stronger economy and higher income for
the people.
284.
These transformations were possible because generations of Hong Kong people
have worked hard, stayed flexible, and never given up.  That grit is part of our DNA, and
it will continue to be the engine that drives us forward.
285.
We must not be complacent, nor should we underestimate our own capabilities.
In the last three years, Hong Kong has climbed higher thanks to the teamwork of
the Government and the community.  We have risen one spot to become the world’s
third-largest international financial centre, and our overall competitiveness has jumped
four places to also rank third globally.  In talent competitiveness, we have leapt twelve
spots, now sitting at fourth in the world.  The number of registered local companies has
hit a record high, as has the number of non-local companies setting up operations in
Hong Kong.  The median household income has also grown by 11%, an increase of $3,000.
These numbers tell a clear story: investors around the world trust Hong Kong, and our city
is vibrant, stable, and poised for long-term growth under “One Country, Two Systems”.
286.
Hong Kong faces challenges and is also presented with continuing
opportunities amid the changing world.  Our country, the world’s second-largest economy,
is our staunchest supporter and the source of our biggest opportunities.  Combined with
Hong Kong’s international prospects, our opportunities far outweigh the challenges.  By
working together, innovating, and embracing reform, we will turn our beloved Hong Kong
into an even better home for everyone.  The Pearl of the Orient will keep shining brighter
than ever before.
81
Annex: Indicators for Specified Tasks
1.
In the 2024 Policy Address, I set a total of 138 indicators for specified tasks, of which 72 were
new.  This has helped foster the Government’s result-oriented culture and enabled me to
monitor work progress and outcomes more effectively.
2.
I have reviewed the implementation of these indicators, including “tasks completed”
(covering several tasks which are completed by now but with delay in the interim), “tasks
on track”, and even “tasks exceeding targets”26.  For the three indicators that have yet to be
completed as scheduled, they all have reasonable causes for the delay.  Their positions are as
follows:
(i)
Take
forward
the
development
of
the
Northern
Metropolis
by announcing specific
suggestions in Q1 2025 on
the formation of a company
by the Government for
operating a pilot industry
park in an NDA.
While preparing the Budget in February this year,
the Government noted that a tender was in progress
for the lot adjacent to the sites for the industry park
in Hung Shui Kiu to be rolled out by the DEVB.
Since announcing the actual site location of the
industry park and details of the company may
compromise the fairness of the tender exercise, the
Financial Secretary’s consent was obtained to release
details of the company for the pilot industry park
after completion of the tender exercise.
After reviewing the situation, the Government
considered that the said lot, which had been put
up for tender and was located on the skirt outside
the industry park in Hung Shui Kiu, should better
be incorporated into the industry park to achieve
economies of scale.  The Government announced, on
21 July this year, the cancellation of the tender for the
lot and the new proposed direction.  The DEVB is
revising the planning for the expanded new industry
park and adjusting details of the park company.
The DEVB will report to the Working Group on
Devising Development and Operation Models to
be established, as announced in this year’s Policy
Address, and announce the proposal within this
year.
26
Such as the FSTB shall facilitate 200 family offices by end-2025 but it has completed the task in August; and the
CEDB shall attract 1 130 companies by end-2025, yet the indicator has been met ahead of schedule reaching
1 365 companies, bringing about $175.4 billion of investment and 19 900 job opportunities.
82
(ii)
Expedite urban renewal
by formulating in the
first half of 2025 policy
proposals on the use of
newly developed land to
drive large-scale urban
redevelopment projects.
After examining the proposals submitted by the
DEVB in mid-2025, the Chief Executive considered
that the measures related to the URA’s Flat-for-Flat
Scheme were not specific enough, and that the
incentives targeting areas with a more pressing
need for redevelopment could be enhanced, so
that private redevelopment projects could be taken
forward more effectively.  The Chief Executive
directed the DEVB to further study the matter and
submit refined proposals within two months.  The
DEVB submitted refined proposals in late August
this year, which were agreed by the Chief Executive
and incorporated for promulgation in paragraphs
219(ii) and (iii) of this year’s Policy Address.
(iii)
Set
up
the
Teacher
Professional Development
Fund in the 2024/25 school
year (i.e. from September
2024 to August 2025) to
continuously enhance the
training and exchange
programmes for teachers.
In the Budget announced in February 2025, the
Government proposed revising the financial
arrangements for six seed capital funds, each with a
relatively large unspent balance, as well as reviewing
the financial arrangements for 36 funds.
Since the review would take time to complete and
its results might have a chain effect on the Teacher
Professional Development Fund, the EDB considered
that it could use its existing resources to provide
teacher professional development programmes until
the 2027/28 school year.  The EDB therefore halted
the setting up of the fund and reported the situation
at the meeting of the LegCo Panel on Financial
Affairs in April 2025.  Its action was supported by
the Chief Executive and the Financial Secretary.
3.
In addition, last year’s Policy Address put forward to complete the statutory environmental
impact (EIA) procedures for the reclamation works under the Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands
project within this year.  While the relevant EIA Report was made ready last year, given
the implementation programme of the Kau Yi Chau project has been slowed down and no
specific arrangements have been made, the DEVB, after reviewing the situation, considers
it inappropriate to proceed with the relevant statutory EIA procedures at this stage, but will
complete the ongoing studies so that the analysis and information acquired may be retained
for reference.  The Financial Secretary and I accept and agree to it.
4.
For this year’s Policy Address, I have set a total of 140 indicators, including 79 new
indicators, and 61 indicators introduced in the 2024 Policy Address that are in progress and
still valid.  Details are as follows:
83
